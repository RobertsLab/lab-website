We’re excited to share that **Madeline Baird**, an undergraduate researcher in the Roberts Lab, will present her research at the **2025 Mary Gates Undergraduate Research Symposium**.

Her poster presentation, titled

**“Application of Metabolic Assays to Characterize Thermal Tolerance in Pacific Oyster (Magallana gigas) Early Life Stages,”**

investigates how parental immune priming affects offspring resilience in a changing ocean. Collaborating with the **Jamestown Shellfish Hatchery**, Madeline reared juvenile oysters from immune-challenged parents and assessed growth, survival, and metabolism under a wide range of temperatures.

Using high-throughput **resazurin metabolic assays**, she found that immune-primed offspring showed greater thermal tolerance—especially between 36°C and 40°C—highlighting a potentially important role of **metabolic flexibility** in inherited stress resilience.

> 🔬 These findings support the idea that **non-genetic inheritance** may help oysters adapt to increasing marine heatwaves—an insight with valuable implications for aquaculture and conservation.

Madeline’s work was supported by the **USDA**, **Washington Sea Grant**, and the **UW Population Health Initiative**, which recognized her with a **2025 Population Health Recognition Award**.
