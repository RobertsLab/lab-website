# Marine science mentoring over the summer at FHL

Spending the summer at [Friday Harbor Labs](https://fhl.uw.edu/) (FHL), SAFS grad student [Chris Mantegna](https://faculty.washington.edu/sr320/people.html#chris-mantegna) mentored four students -- two as part of the NSF-funded [Research Experience for Undergrads-Blinks](https://fhl.uw.edu/research/summer-research-internships/) (REU) program and two as part of the [Doris Duke Conservation Scholars Program](http://uwconservationscholars.org/) (DDCSP). During the program, students get to collaborate on a research project with their scientist-mentor to build marine research skills.

Specifically geared towards enhancing diversity within the marine sciences, the program welcomes students from underrepresented groups. This year, Chris\' students came from institutions across the US, including Kentucky, Massachusetts, Vermont and North Carolina, to work with her on an intertidal monitoring survey on Yellow Island in the Salish Sea.

The REU-Blinks program based out of FHL takes advantage of the pristine environment, remarkable biodiversity, and the scientific and technical resources available at the marine science research facility. The DDCSP program aims to increase diversity in conservation work and allows students from all over the US a chance to participate in a two-year program where second year scholars participate in an onsite internship of their choosing.
