Celebrating and highlighting the work of LGBTQ+ people in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) has a special day on the calendar: November 18. Why this date? It is based on the 60^th^ anniversary of American Astronomer and gay activist Frank Kameny's fight against workplace discrimination, which he took to the U.S. Supreme Court.

Science is a place of innovation, research, and progress, but many communities are still marginalized in these spaces. [Pride in STEM](https://prideinstem.org/lgbtstemday/) notes that 28% of LGBT+ people have considered leaving their jobs because of discrimination or workplace hostility.

On [LGBTQ+ in STEM Day](https://prideinstem.org/lgbtstemday), we celebrate the contribution of LGBTQ+ scientists, while also recognizing that barriers are still faced and that efforts have to continue to break these down. We spoke with SAFS graduate student, Aspen Coyle, who shared her thoughts on her journey so far in academia, what inclusion means for her, and some of the barriers and highlights she's experienced. She also shares some advice for those concerned about a lack of representation in marine science.

## **What led you to pursue studies in science?**

![](https://fish.uw.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/29/2023/10/Aspen_selfie-259x528.jpg){alt=""}

I'm one of those people that's wanted to be a marine biologist ever since I was a little kid. I grew up in a fishing town in coastal Alaska, and my favorite thing in the world was scrambling along the intertidal, peering into tidepools and turning over rocks, trying to find the neatest critters. That base delight in hunting for cool creatures was augmented in undergrad with a deeper understanding of the ecological importance, and then after getting a job in another Alaskan fishing town, the economic importance.

## **What are some of the positive experiences as LGBTQ+ in STEM that you've had?**
