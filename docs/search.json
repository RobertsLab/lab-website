    "text": "Research in our lab focuses on characterizing physiological responses of marine organisms to environmental change. Using integrative approaches we strive to examine impacts and adaptive potential from the nucleotide to organismal level. A core component of this includes investigating the functional relationship of genetics, epigenetics, and protein expression. Three major themes of are current projects include Environmental Epigenetics, Reproductive Biology and Ecology, and Aquaculture Resource Development.\n\nEnvironmental Epigenetics\n\n\nCollaborative Research: URoL : Epigenetics 2: Predicting phenotypic and eco-evolutionary consequences of environmental-energetic-epigenetic linkages\nSummary: Living organisms may acclimate to environmental changes through epigenetic modifications to DNA, which alter the way genetic instructions are interpreted without altering the DNA code itself. While these modifications to organismal phenotype or function can be reversible, some of them may be inherited by offspring, potentially producing multiple, heritable outcomes from a single genome and affecting ecological and evolutionary outcomes. This project uses symbiotic, metabolically complex reef building corals as a model system to test the connections between physiological, epigenetic, and metabolic states, and predict how population and community dynamics are influenced by epigenetically-modulated phenotypes. This work will advance biological knowledge by delineating fundamental links (Rules of Life) between ubiquitous organismal energetic processes, epigenetics, and eco-evolutionary outcomes. The Broader Impacts activities parallel the project’s integrative approach, linking insights from Environment x Energetics x Epigenetics x Ecology for Education into an E5 platform. The E5 platform will provide i) early career STEM training, ii) local and global community education, and iii) educational resources for open science, quantitative approaches, and research reproducibility. Further, this E5 platform will train and inform the next generation of diverse scientists and public by combining local and global initiatives focusing on groups underrepresented in STEM.\nThis project examines how nutrient metabolism in the mitochondria generates cofactors and energy that will instruct the epigenetic machinery in the cell nucleus to modulate genome function to appropriately respond to environmental conditions. Environmentally-responsive metabolic function and energetic-epigenetic linkages act as drivers of complex emergent phenotypes. To elucidate relationships that are the basis for Rules of Life with respect to epigenetics, this project will use integrative experimental and modeling approaches focused on reef building corals to: 1) link nutritionally-provisioned metabolites with epigenetic and organismal state through seasonal sampling across environmental gradients; 2) expand current Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) models for symbiotic organisms to further integrate critical facets of nutritional symbiosis and calcification; 3) experimentally modulate metabolic and therefore epigenetic states through repeated exposure to increased temperature and nutrients, to test intra- and trans-generational epigenetic inheritance; 4) use DEB theory to identify shifts in energetics associated with epigenetic modulation, and link these sub-organismal processes to higher levels of organization; and 5) integrate findings into a generalizable, predictive eco-evolutionary model that links nutritional interactions, metabolic states, and subsequent epigenetic effects to the timescales regulating organismal processes and eco-evolutionary outcomes. This effort will provide characterization of environmental epigenetic phenomena in ecosystem-engineering marine invertebrates. This characterization includes determining the mechanisms and the degree of epigenetic ‘memory’ both within and across generations. By including information on environmental legacies, propagated by epigenetics, this project will advance both organismal and population-based models and improve capacity to predict responses to acute and chronic environmental signals.\n\n\nCollaborative Research: Does ocean acidification induce a methylation response that affects the fitness of the next generation in oysters?\nSummary: Marine ecosystems worldwide are threatened by ocean acidification, a process caused by the unprecedented rate at which carbon dioxide is increasing in the atmosphere. Since ocean change is predicted to be rapid, extreme, and widespread, marine species may face an “adapt-or-die” scenario. However, modifications to the DNA sequence may be induced in response to a stress like ocean acidification and then inherited. Such “epigenetic” modifications may hold the key to population viability under global climate change, but they have been understudied. The aim of this research is to characterize the role of DNA methylation, a heritable epigenetic system, in the response of Eastern oysters (Crassostrea virginica) to ocean acidification. The intellectual merit lies in the integrative approach, which will characterize the role of DNA methylation in the intergenerational response of oysters to ocean acidification. These interdisciplinary data, spanning from molecular to organismal levels, will provide insight into mechanisms that underlie the capacity of marine invertebrates to respond to ocean acidification and lay the foundation for future transgenerational studies. Ocean acidification currently threatens marine species worldwide and has already caused significant losses in aquaculture, especially in Crassostrea species. This research has broader impacts for breeding, aquaculture, and the economy. Under the investigators’ “Epigenetics to Ocean” (E2O) training program, the investigators will build STEM talent in bioinformatics and biogeochemistry, expose girls in low-income school districts to careers in genomics, and advance the field through open science and reproducibility.\n\n\nElucidating the physiological and epigenetic response of tetraploid and triploid Pacific Oysters (Crassostrea gigas) to environmental stressors\nSummary: Basic physiological studies will be conducted with diploid, triploid and tetraploid larvae produced from the same MBP lines to determine tolerances to three environmental factors which are being altered by climate change. These include temperature, salinity and low pH, individually and in combination. Differential response will be assessed by changes in oxygen consumption rates, shell morphology and survival rates. Cohorts of diploid, triploid and tetraploid juvenile oysters will be grown out in several locations in the two States and closely monitored for survival and performance (e.g. growth rate, condition index). Shotgun proteomics will be used to permit efficient comparison of protein expression patterns on the entire genome. Changes in global DNA methylation will also be examined to assess the role of the environment in influencing the epigenetic landscape, and how this translates to phenotype. A subset of oysters from the first experiments will be selected for spawning larvae that can then be similarly assessed to determine how parental environmental conditions affect larval performance.\n\n\nImproving genomic resources to support restoration and protection of the Olympia Oyster in Puget Sound\nSummary: There is a significant gap in our fundamental understanding of this species’ resilience in the face of environmental change, ecological interactions, and population structure. This information is critical to local restoration efforts and to predicting how molluscs will adapt to long-term environmental change. There is recent evidence that oysters have the capacity to respond to environmental change at a rate beyond what would be predicted by genetic variation alone. The overall objective of this research is to produce genomic resources and capacity to understand the response of Olympia oysters to environmental change. Specifically, a draft genome assembly for the Olympia oyster will be produced and used to understand how responses of the Olympia oyster to environmental changes are inherited (i.e., genetic or epigenetic) using restriction site associated DNA sequencing (RAD-Seq) and bisulfite sequencing (BS-Seq). A web-based platform will be developed based on these resources that will be used for discovery and further collaboration.\n\nReproductive Biology and Ecology\n\n\n\nApplying cutting-edge technology for reproductive control in emerging bivalve species\nSummary: Given the supreme importance of maintaining ecological security in expanding shellfish farming to meet the global demand for environmentally sustainable protein, our goal is to engage a novel mix of disciplines to create new knowledge leading to an optimal approach for conferring sterility in emerging shellfish species. We have assembled an interdisciplinary team including aquaculture specialists, molecular physiologists, and single cell genomicists to tackle the critical initial step in this approach: the identification of genes involved in germ cell fate at the earliest developmental stages in geoducks. We anticipate identifying several germ cell- specific genes that when disrupted effectively turn off germ cell differentiation, yielding sterile products that do not undergo gonadogenesis, exhibit superior performance, and cannot disrupt genetic structure of ecosystems. Identification of these genes will be the measure of success for the proposed work. These gene targets will be the focus of future stages of research that determines how to best disrupt reproductive function without impacting growth performance.\n\n\nEnhancing sustainability of shellfish aquaculture through streamlined maturation control\nSummary: The proposed objectives cover the essential first steps toward generating sterile bivalves via molecular disruption of germ cell formation. The first step in the process is the identification of genes involved in primordial germ cell (PGC) specification in bivalves via single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA- Seq). This cutting-edge technique is particularly suited to identify germ cell markers in bivalves, since germ cell precursors represent a small number of cells in developing embryos. This information is integral to being able to control germ cell fate for reproductive sterilization of aquaculture species, and our proposed use of scRNA-Seq for directed application to aquaculture is both novel and potentially highly beneficial to the broader shellfish aquaculture community. Our first specific research aim is to characterize genomic processes involved in germ cell specification in Pacific oysters. A second fundamental step in the process is the optimization of techniques to deliver targeted, gene-regulating molecules to embryos to inhibit germ cell formation. Methods to optimize delivery techniques, including the use of CRISPR-Cas9 and morpholino constructs, have yet to be developed for bivalve embryos. Therefore, our second specific research aim is to optimize delivery techniques of custom gene-regulating molecules to oyster embryos. The completion of these objectives sets the stage for a more effective and sustainable approach for sterilization of shellfish.\n\n\nEffects of temperature change and Hematodinium sp. infection (Bitter Crab Disease) on Tanner crab (Chionoecetes bairdi)\nSummary: Changing climate conditions, due to increasing releases of CO2 into the atmosphere, are causing warming of the world’s oceans. Changes in seawater temperatures are predicted to cause a shift in the distribution and a change in the abundance of most plants and animals. For most species, the magnitude of the impact, the potential for adaptation to future temperatures, and the mechanisms for adaptation are unknown. Features of parasite/disease ecology are also predicted to change as oceans warm, including susceptibility of hosts to disease, host ability to combat disease once infected, and alterations in pathogen virulence. Alaskan Tanner crab stocks, supporting fisheries worth $21 million in 2014, are expected to be significantly impacted directly and indirectly by warming temperatures. The Alaska Department of Fish and Game considers bitter crab disease, caused by a parasitic dinoflagellate, Hematodinium, to be the ‘principle threat’ to Alaskan Tanner crab stocks. Infection rates in the Bering Sea and southeast Alaska range from 2-5% and 0-100%, respectively. In heavily infected hosts, the meat is soft and chalky with a bitter taste, rendering the crabs unmarketable. The disease is believed fatal, although the time from infection to death remains uncertain. Recent worldwide spread of Hematodinium infections appears to have closely followed warming trends in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. We postulate that increased temperature in the North Pacific will physiologically stress Tanner crabs and also lead to increased prevalence of Hematodinium infections, either of which may lead to increased mortality in Tanner crabs. We propose to hold healthy and Hematodinium-infected Tanner crabs under different temperature regimes testing for a genetic response to infection and temperature. Our research will provide insight into the underlying mechanistic linkages between potential effects of climate change and important processes such as recruitment, growth and natural mortality on Alaskan Tanner crab stocks.\n\nAquaculture Resource Development\n\n\n\nDevelopment of environmental conditioning practices to decrease impacts of climate change on shellfish aquaculture\nSummary: The project will be completed using commercial hatchery rearing of geoduck clams. We will test and implement shellfish performance enhancement methods through the use of environmental stressor preconditioning, or “hardening”. The objectives of this work are to A) Identify key stages in the geoduck life cycle when environmental conditioning can be applied for optimal benefits to productivity, including: - Broodstock conditioning and reproductive performance, - Larval growth and survivorship, and - Juvenile resistance to stress through repeated exposures, B) Use genomics and epigenomics to identify underlying mechanisms involved in enhanced performance. This will provide mechanistic information that enables the application of optimal preconditioning approaches in other shellfish species.\nThis project directly addresses the research topics of genomics, quantitative genetics, and phenomics in the less studied, yet viable, geoduck clam. The proposed work is based on our group’s prior finding that some exposure to low pH conditions can improve larval and juvenile performance traits. The research proposed will integrate and further test these findings in a commercial shellfish hatchery setting and determine the genetic and epigenetic markers associated with improved performance. In addition, we will explore how the “memory” of prior exposure increases later performance such that epigenetic markers could be leveraged in broodstock management and hatchery practices. A number of phenotypes will be assessed, as well as the underlying genomic factors, including fecundity, survival, and growth.\n\n\nCaligusLIFE: Scientific research of excellence towards understanding sea lice biology and its application in control strategies for the salmon industry\nSummary: This project will address specifically the generation of new knowledge in the areas of the Biological Cycle of Caligus and Genomics. The aim is to identify those environmental and genetic factors that significantly impact the life cycle of Caligus. This information will be used to generate mathematical models that calculate fecundity and production of Caligus and describe the spatio-temporal patterns of dispersion that explain the observed patterns of infestation in the field. The genomic part will include wide genome sequencing (WGS), assembly and functional annotation of Caligus and epigenomics.\n\nComparative Epigenomic Analyses across Bivalve Genome Resources (CEABiGR)\nSummary: Bivalve mollusks constitute the major players in US aquaculture production with oysters, mussels, and clams bringing in over $300 million in 2016 (NOAA Fisheries). There are several genomes of economically important bivalves with several other species’ genomes in the midst of completion. Further, numerous labs across the US are working on the functional annotations of these genomes including characterizing aspects of genetic, epigenetic and microbiome variation. There is a wealth of disparate information (WGS, RAD-Seq, bisulfite sequence data, metagenomics, and data sets associated with miRNAs, lncRNAs, and histone modifications) that when integrated would significantly advance our functional understanding of bivalve genomes. The integration of these datasets in a comparative fashion will improve the annotation of all bivalve genomes and provide valuable resources for the entire community. We are requesting funds to support a workshop for researchers to come together and focus on improving the assembly and annotation of bivalve genomes in a comparative framework. This workshop will be planned for 2020 and will be held at the University of Washington. The format of the workshop will be modeled after the very successful NRSP-8 supported workshop hosted by Dr. Hollie Putnam at the University of Rhode Island focused on the Eastern oyster (https:// github.com/hputnam/FROGER). The functional analysis methods developed during the FROGER meeting will be further developed for application across bivalve species.\n\n\n\nLeveraging transformative ’omics technologies to alleviate barriers to US shellfish production (Omics Tech)\nSummary: Objectives: It is difficult to overstate the importance of triploid oysters to the commercial shellfish industry. Our goal is to uncover fundamental genomic and physiological differences between diploid and triploid Pacific oysters leading to low survival in subpar grow-out environments, and apply this information to increase sustainable commercial aquaculture production. The specific research objectives of our proposal are to: • Evaluate performance differentiation between triploid and diploid oysters under specific and combined stress conditions. • Identify and characterize physiological mechanisms and genomic infrastructure underlying poor performance in triploid oysters in hatchery and grow-out conditions.\n\n\nDevelopment of ’omics and bioinformatics approaches for marine organisms in support of research in aquaculture, ocean acidification, and fisheries assessments (Aqua-Omics)\nSummary: The rapid development of molecular genetic methodology over the last decade has led to transformative change in many areas of biology and medicine. In particular, the emergence of high-throughput, or next-generation, DNA sequencing technology has dramatically increased capacity for the generation of data a million-fold. Many of the traditional types of genetic analysis, including descriptions of population structure, trait mapping, individual identification and identification of stock boundaries and distributions, have been enabled by these new data sources in ways that were unimaginable several decades ago. These include detection of focal species in habitat with unknown occupancy, evaluation of species or stock composition in particular time/area strata of fishery management areas from water samples, the elucidation of trophic relationships between marine animals, their predators and prey, from gut contents or fecal matter, and understanding the genetic basis of environmentally-relevant, adaptive or aquaculture-relevant traits.\nIn this project, we will add capacity to collaborative research between partners at the University of Washington and the Northwest Fisheries Science Center, addressing objectives of key importance to the National Marine Fisheries Service mission. These include contributions to the development of ’omics and bioinformatics workflows for both data generation and data analysis (bioinformatics). Though the focus of the project is varied in taxonomic interest, the fundamental basis of the project is tied together for similarities in how data are generated and subsequently processed for questions of interest. In this project, our goal is to contribute to bioinformatics tools and workflows for research relevant to species assessments, aquaculture, and ocean acidification research.\n\n\nDevelopment of innovative approaches to support sustainable aquaculture and understand the effects of ocean acidification on marine species (Vernon)\nSummary: Environmental variability due to climate change and ocean acidification (OA) are having multifaceted impacts on marine species, ecosystems and human industries such as marine aquaculture. It is absolutely critical to understand how marine organisms, and industries that rely on them, will respond to these changing conditions. Arguably, it will be just as important to provide tools and best practices to mitigate these effects, and in the case of marine aquaculture – find solutions to increase sustainability of the sector broadly, to create resilience even in the face of environmental uncertainty. Innovative scientific solutions are required to meet these ongoing and future challenges. In this project, we will add capacity to collaborative research between partners at the University of Washington and the Northwest Fisheries Science Center, addressing objectives of key importance to the National Marine Fisheries Service mission. These include innovative problem-solving approaches to address challenges facing sustainable aquaculture development, understanding the impacts of climate variability on marine fish and shellfish, and woven throughout these research activities is the development of ’omics and bioinformatics workflows for both data generation and data analysis (bioinformatics). Through this composite project, our goal is to contribute to applications to support sustainable aquaculture, increase our understanding of the effects of OA on marine fish and shellfish and contribute bioinformatic capacity, tools and workflows for research related to aquaculture, genomics and climate change.\n\n\nReadying sustainable aquaculture for a changing ocean: uncovering the mechanisms associated with intergenerational carryover effects to enhance bivalve resilience to acidification\nSummary: The proposed effort will identify how parental environmental conditions drive shellfish offspring performance, including describing underlying mechanisms. To do this we will examine intergenerational effects of ocean acidification in the Manila clam, a globally cultured species that will serve as a model for marine bivalves and related taxa. By comprehensively investigating gamete status following parental pCO2 exposures, this project will uncover the non-genetic carriers of information across generations while simultaneously identifying factors that predict high performance of larvae in acidified conditions. By leveraging and working closely on a complementary NOAA supported project, we are able to expand our traditional research objectives with an objective centered around increasing diversity and inclusion in marine sciences. The specific objectives include 1) Characterize carryover performance in clams in response to ocean acidification, 2) Identify maternal macromolecule contribution of intergenerational plasticity and carryover performance, 3) Identify paternal epigenetic signatures associated with intergenerational plasticity and carryover performance, and 4) Develop inclusive educational experiences and products for underserved groups. The proposed work supports Washington Sea Grants commitment to cultivating partnerships and practicing a commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion. The objectives directly align with the critical program areas of Sustainable Fisheries and Aquaculture, Ocean Literacy and Workforce Development, and Healthy Coastal Ecosystems."

    "text": "Abstract\nTanner crab (Chionoecetes bairdi) is an economically important species that is threatened by ocean warming and bitter crab disease, which is caused by an endoparasitic dinoflagellate, Hematodinium. Little is known about disease transmission or its link to host mortality, or how ocean warming will affect pathogenicity or host susceptibility. To provide a transcriptomic resource for the Tanner crab, we generated a suite of RNA-seq libraries encompassing pooled hemolymph samples from crab displaying differing infection statuses and maintained at different temperatures (ambient (7.5˚C), elevated (10˚C), or decreased (4˚C)). After assembling a transcriptome and performing a multifactor differential gene expression analysis, we found genes influenced by temperature in relation to infection and detected some of those genes over time at the individual level using RNA-seq data from one crab. Biological processes associated with those genes include lipid storage, transcription, response to oxidative stress, cell adhesion, and morphogenesis. Alteration in lipid storage and transcription provide insight into how temperature impacts energy allocation in Hematodinium infected crabs. Alteration in expression patterns in genes associated with morphogenesis could suggest that hemocytes were changing morphology and/or type in response to temperature. This project provides insight into how Hematodinium infection could influence crab physiology as oceans warm."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nThere is a growing focus on the role of DNA methylation in the ability of marine invertebrates to rapidly respond to changing environmental factors and anthropogenic impacts. However, genome-wide DNA methylation studies in nonmodel organisms are currently hampered by a limited understanding of methodological biases. Here, we compare three methods for quantifying DNA methylation at single base-pair resolution—whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS), reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS), and methyl-CpG binding domain bisulfite sequencing (MBDBS)—using multiple individuals from two reef-building coral species with contrasting environmental sensitivity. All methods reveal substantially greater methylation in Montipora capitata (11.4%) than the more sensitive Pocillopora acuta (2.9%). The majority of CpG methylation in both species occurs in gene bodies and flanking regions. In both species, MBDBS has the greatest capacity for detecting CpGs in coding regions at our sequencing depth, but MBDBS may be influenced by intrasample methylation heterogeneity. RRBS yields robust information for specific loci albeit without enrichment of any particular genome feature and with significantly reduced genome coverage. Relative genome size strongly influences the number and location of CpGs detected by each method when sequencing depth is limited, illuminating nuances in cross-species comparisons. As genome-wide methylation differences, supported by data across bisulfite sequencing methods, may contribute to environmental sensitivity phenotypes in critical marine invertebrate taxa, these data provide a genomic resource for investigating the functional role of DNA methylation in environmental tolerance."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nPolyploidy has been shown to negatively impact environmental stress tolerance, resulting in increased susceptibility to extreme climate events such as marine heatwaves (MHWs). In this study, we used the response of the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas to MHWs as a model system to identify key ploidy-specific differences in the physiological and transcriptomic response of oysters to environmental stress. In this study, adult diploid (2n) and triploid (3n) oysters were exposed to elevated seawater temperature (single stressor; 30°C), elevated temperature followed by acute desiccation stress (multiple stressor; 30°C + emersion at an aerial temperature of 44°C for 4h), or a control (17°C) within a hatchery setting. Oyster mortality rate was elevated within stress treatments with respect to the control and was significantly higher in triploids than diploids following multiple stress exposure (36.4% vs. 14.8%). Triploids within the multiple stressor treatment exhibited signs of energetic limitation, including metabolic depression, a significant reduction in ctenidium Na+/K+ ATPase activity, and the dysregulated expression of key genes associated with heat tolerance, the inhibition of apoptosis, and mitochondrial function. Functional enrichment analysis of ploidy-specific gene sets identified that biological processes associated with metabolism, stress tolerance, and immune function were overrepresented within triploids across stress treatments. Our results demonstrate that triploidy impacts the transcriptional regulation of key metabolic processes that underly the environmental stress response of Pacific oysters, resulting in downstream shifts in physiological tolerance limits that may be detrimental to survival. The impact of chromosome set manipulation on the climate resilience of marine populations has important implications for the adaptability of marine populations and domestic food security within future climate scenarios, especially as triploidy induction becomes an increasingly popular tool to elicit reproductive control across a wide range of marine organisms used within marine aquaculture."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nFor ectothermic marine invertebrates living in temperate regions, impacts of ocean warming will vary considerably by season. In many species, reproductive and metabolic processes are tightly linked to the seasonal change from winter to spring, yet we know little about how these processes will shift as winters become milder. This study examined latent effects of winter warming on spring reproduction in the Olympia oyster, Ostrea lurida. Adults were collected in autumn from central Puget Sound, WA, USA, and exposed to two winter temperatures (7 °C, 10 °C) in the presence of food limited (5 k algal cells/mL) and food abundant (50 k algal cells/mL) environments. Following treatments, adults exposed to elevated winter temperature contained larger oocytes regardless of feeding regime, and those also fed abundant food contained more developed sperm. Adults then spawned in common conditions, and larvae were reared through settlement to assess carryover effects of winter treatments on larval viability. Adults previously exposed to elevated winter temperature (10 °C) produced larger larvae, particularly if they were also fed high food levels. More developed gametes and larger larvae suggest that gametogenesis occurred at low levels throughout the winter, possibly resulting in increased maternal provisioning to influence larval size. Interestingly, winter temperature did not impact larval survival, or the timing or magnitude of larval production. In the wild, more developed gametes and larger larvae following milder winters could greatly impact recruitment patterns, possibly benefitting O. lurida populations. In the hatchery setting, larval production and survival is not contingent upon winter conditions, and larval survival does not correlate with oocyte and larval size. Our results suggest that O. lurida reproduction is resilient to winter warming. Furthermore, as global temperature continues to rise, winter conditions should not be overlooked when examining reproduction in O. lurida and other temperate marine invertebrates with similar reproductive cycles."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nBackground Sublethal exposure to environmental challenges may enhance ability to cope with chronic or repeated change, a process known as priming. In a previous study, pre-exposure to seawater enriched with pCO2 improved growth and reduced antioxidant capacity of juvenile Pacific geoduck Panopea generosa clams, suggesting that transcriptional shifts may drive phenotypic modifications post-priming. To this end, juvenile clams were sampled and TagSeq gene expression data were analysed after (i) a 110-day acclimation under ambient (921 μatm, naïve) and moderately elevated pCO2 (2870 μatm, pre-exposed); then following (ii) a second 7-day exposure to three pCO2 treatments (ambient: 754 μatm; moderately elevated: 2750 μatm; severely elevated: 4940 μatm), a 7-day return to ambient pCO2 and a third 7-day exposure to two pCO2 treatments (ambient: 967 μatm; moderately elevated: 3030 μatm). Pre-exposed geoducks frontloaded genes for stress and apoptosis/innate immune response, homeostatic processes, protein degradation and transcriptional modifiers. Pre-exposed geoducks were also responsive to subsequent encounters, with gene sets enriched for mitochondrial recycling and immune defence under elevated pCO2 and energy metabolism and biosynthesis under ambient recovery. In contrast, gene sets with higher expression in naïve clams were enriched for fatty-acid degradation and glutathione components, suggesting naïve clams could be depleting endogenous fuels, with unsustainable energetic requirements if changes in carbonate chemistry persist. Collectively, our transcriptomic data indicate that pCO2 priming during post-larval periods could, via gene expression regulation, enhance robustness in bivalves to environmental change. Such priming approaches may be beneficial for aquaculture, as seafood demand intensifies concurrent with increasing climate change in marine systems."

    "text": "Abstract\nGiven the rapidly changing global climate, there is a growing need to understand the acclimatory basis of animal response to environmental change. To investigate the role of DNA methylation in environmental acclimatization, we generated a reference genome and surveyed the physiology and DNA methylomes of juvenile geoduck clams, Panopea generosa, under differing seawater pH regimes. Juveniles were initially exposed to one of three seawater pH conditions, followed by ambient common-garden conditions, then a second reciprocal exposure to ambient pH or pH 7.4. Within 10 days of the initial low pH exposure, juvenile clams showed decreased shell size relative to ambient pH with corresponding differential DNA methylation. Following four months of ambient common-garden conditions, juveniles initially exposed to low pH compensatorily grew larger, with DNA methylation indicative of these phenotypic differences, demonstrating epigenetic carryover effects persisted months after initial exposure. Functional enrichment analysis of differentially methylated genes revealed regulation of signal transduction through widespread changes in the Wnt signaling pathways that influence cell growth, proliferation, tissue and skeletal formation, and cytoskeletal change. After 10 days of secondary exposure to pH 7.4, naive juvenile clams were more sensitive to low pH compared to those initially exposed, showing reduced growth and having nearly a 2-fold greater change in DNA methylation. Collectively, this new genomic resource and coordinated phenotypic and methylomic response support that epigenetic mechanisms underlie acclimatization to provide beneficial phenotypes."

    "text": "Abstract\nFor marine invertebrates with a pelagic–benthic life cycle, larval exposure to ocean acidification (OA) can affect adult performance in response to another environmental stressor. This carry-over effect has the potential to alter phenotypic traits. However, the molecular mechanisms that mediate “OA”-triggered carry-over effects have not been explored despite such information being key to improving species fitness and management strategies for aquafarming. This study integrated the genome-wide DNA methylome and transcriptome to examine epigenetic modification-mediated carry-over OA impacts on phenotypic traits of the ecologically and commercially important oyster species Crassostrea hongkongensis under field conditions. Larvae of C. hongkongensis were exposed to control pH 8.0 and low pH 7.4 conditions, mimicking near future OA scenario in their habitat, before being outplanted as post-metamorphic juveniles at two mariculture field sites with contrasting environmental stressors for 9 months. The larval carry-over OA effect was found to have persistent impacts on the growth and survival trade-off traits on the outplanted juveniles, although the beneficial or adverse effect depended on the environmental conditions at the outplanted sites. Site-specific plasticity was demonstrated with a diverse DNA methylation-associated gene expression profile, with signal transduction and the endocrine system being the most common and highly enriched functions. Highly methylated exons prevailed in the key genes related to general metabolic and endocytic responses and these genes are evolutionarily conserved in various marine invertebrates in response to OA. These results suggest that oysters with prior larval exposure history to OA had the ability to trigger rapid local adaptive responses via epigenetic modification to cope with multiple stressors in the field."

    "text": "Abstract\nSymbiosis with protists is common among cnidarians such as corals and sea anemones and is associated with homeostatic and phenotypic changes in the host that could have epigenetic underpinnings, such as methylation of CpG dinucleotides. We leveraged the sensitivity to base modifications of nanopore sequencing to probe the effect of symbiosis with the chlorophyte Elliptochloris marina on methylation in the sea anemone Anthopleura elegantissima. We first validated the approach by comparison of nanopore-derived methylation levels with CpG depletion analysis of a published transcriptome, finding that high methylation levels are associated with CpG depletion as expected. Next, using reads generated exclusively from aposymbiotic anemones, a largely complete draft genome comprising 243 Mb was assembled. Reads from aposymbiotic and symbiotic sea anemones were then mapped to this genome and assessed for methylation using the program Nanopolish, which detects signal disruptions from base modifications as they pass through the nanopore. Based on assessment of 452,841 CpGs for which there was adequate read coverage (approximately 8% of the CpGs in the genome), symbiosis with E. marina was, surprisingly, associated with only subtle changes in the host methylome. However, we did identify one extended genomic region with consistently higher methylation among symbiotic individuals. The region was associated with a DNA polymerase zeta that is noted for its role in translesion synthesis, which opens interesting questions about the biology of this symbiosis. Our study highlights the power and relative simplicity of nanopore sequencing for studies of nucleic acid base modifications in non-model species."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nBackground There is a need to investigate mechanisms of phenotypic plasticity in marine invertebrates as negative effects of climate change, like ocean acidification, are experienced by coastal ecosystems. Environmentally-induced changes to the methylome may regulate gene expression, but methylome responses can be species- and tissue-specific. Tissue-specificity has implications for gonad tissue, as gonad-specific methylation patterns may be inherited by offspring. We used the Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) — a model for understanding pH impacts on bivalve molecular physiology due to its genomic resources and importance in global aquaculture— to assess how low pH could impact the gonad methylome. Oysters were exposed to either low pH (7.31 ± 0.02) or ambient pH (7.82 ± 0.02) conditions for 7 weeks. Whole genome bisulfite sequencing was used to identify methylated regions in female oyster gonad samples. C- &gt; T single nucleotide polymorphisms were identified and removed to ensure accurate methylation characterization. Results Analysis of gonad methylomes revealed a total of 1284 differentially methylated loci (DML) found primarily in genes, with several genes containing multiple DML. Gene ontologies for genes containing DML were involved in development and stress response, suggesting methylation may promote gonad growth homeostasis in low pH conditions. Additionally, several of these genes were associated with cytoskeletal structure regulation, metabolism, and protein ubiquitination — commonly-observed responses to ocean acidification. Comparison of these DML with other Crassostrea spp. exposed to ocean acidification demonstrates that similar pathways, but not identical genes, are impacted by methylation. Conclusions Our work suggests DNA methylation may have a regulatory role in gonad and larval development, which would shape adult and offspring responses to low pH stress. Combined with existing molluscan methylome research, our work further supports the need for tissue- and species-specific studies to understand the potential regulatory role of DNA methylation."

In addition to providing the first characterization of genome-wide DNA methylation patterns in the oyster genus Ostrea, we identified 3,963 differentially methylated loci between populations. Our results show a clear coupling between genetic and epigenetic patterns of variation, with 27% of variation in interindividual methylation differences explained by genotype. Underlying this association are both direct genetic changes in CpGs (CpG-SNPs) and genetic variation with indirect influence on methylation (mQTLs).

Oysters maintained at elevated temperatures were larger and had a higher settlement rate, with 86% surviving to the end of the experiment; these oysters also had higher abundance trends of proteins related to metabolism and growth. Oysters held at 23 °C were smaller, had a decreased settlement rate, displayed 100% mortality, and had elevated abundance trends of proteins related to immune response. This novel use of proteomics was able to capture characteristic shifts in protein abundance that hint at important differences in the phenotypic response of Pacific oysters to temperature regimes. Additionally, this work has produced a robust proteomic product that will be the basis for future research on bivalve developmental processes."

Current research efforts include characterizing the adaptive potential of native bivalves in Puget Sound and the functional role of DNA methylation in marine invertebrates.\n\n\n\nGraduate Students\n\nAidan Coyle\nLab notebook | CV | Github | afcoyle@uw.edu\n\nGrowing up in coastal Alaska, I spent most of my youth being poked by sea urchins and stung by jellyfish. Undeterred, I dove into marine research at Bowdoin College, where I found a linkage between cold tolerance and mitochondrial genotype within the invasive European green crab. I then joined the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, where I worked on Bering Sea crab surveys, Tanner crab fecundity and movement studies, and fishery monitoring projects. After moving down to Seattle, I joined the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife, where I researched forage fish spawning and development. At the Roberts lab, I joined my interests in disease and crabs by studying gene expression in southeast Alaskan Tanner crabs and in Hematodinium, the parasitic dinoflagellate that causes Bitter Crab Syndrome. In my free time, I love long-distance cycling and making candy. If you’d like to chat about anything at all (particularly if it happens to be crab-related), feel free to email me!\n\n\nOlivia Cattau\nLab notebook | CV | ocattau@uw.edu | oliviacattau@gmail.com | ORCID iD\n\nAs a Chicago native and University of Chicago alumna, I spent close to zero time on the ocean until I turned 20 and was awarded a Metcalf Internship to study cephalopods at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, MA. After graduating, I moved out to Washington State to work with Puget Sound Restoration Fund and Pacific Hybreed doing shellfish, echinoderm and kelp aquaculture/research. In 2021, I joined the Roberts’ Lab at UW School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences to work on various conservation genetics projects on Geoduck (P. generosa) and Pacific Oysters (C. gigas). Currently, I am working on controling the gonadal development of Geoduck by knockdown of candidate genes involved in primordial germ cell (PGC) specification. This will be done using morpholinos or CRISPER. In addition, I am working with Matt George (mngeorge@uw.edu) on studying environment-physiology interactions within marine organisms, with a particular emphasis on the molecular mechanisms that make aquaculture species within Washington State resilient to environmental change. Feel free to email me with any questions you may have!\n\n\nZach Bengtsson\nLab notebook | zbengt@uw.edu\n\nI grew up in the beautiful, landlocked city of Colorado Springs, CO, but I have always been fascinated by the ocean and marine life. In my undergraduate studies at Boston University, I developed a passion for marine invertebrates and studied coral epibionts living on mangrove prop roots in Belize. After graduating in 2015, I developed my skills in science and research through positions in medical molecular biology, seasonal environmental DNA work at The Nature Conservancy, and various environmental remote sensing roles in the NASA Earth Applied Sciences Program. I joined the Roberts Lab in Fall 2021, where I work on the E5 Coral Project. My research focuses on assessing the response of corals to changing environmental conditions in Moorea using epigenetic techniques. I am also interested in incorporating remotely-sensed datasets as model inputs to better understand the relationship between environmental stressors and organismal response. Please feel free to get in touch with me via email or through my LinkedIn!\n\n\nChris Mantegna\nLab notebook | cnmntgna@uw.edu\n\nDeciding to chase my love of Orcas, coffee, and grunge to the Pacific Northwest has yielded this Baltimore, MD transplant an opportunity to become a double University of Washington alumna. I graduated with my B.S. in Marine Biology in 2021 and am continuing my academic pursuits as a SAFS and NSF Graduate Fellow. Moving into the marine science space has been a dream fulfilled. I am currently using -omics techniques to evaluate the relationship between environmental influences, ecotoxins, and organism physiology in the Pacific Northwest using bivalves as the target organisms. Moving through my graduate work I’d like to expand into warmer waters and study those relationships with Syngnathids as the target organisms. When not working in the lab I happily pepper my daughter with dad jokes, build community as the Mentorship Coordinator for BWEEMS, create content and programming as an active member of BIMS, and spend my free time moonlighting as a wannabe Chihuly in beginners glass blowing classes.\n\n\nShanelle Haughton\nLinkedIn | sohaughton93@gmail.com\n\nI am a New England native and first generation Jamaican-American, born and raised in Hartford, CT. I am currently a fourth year NOAA-LMRCSC funded PhD student in the Marine-Estuarine-Environmental Science program at the University of Maryland Eastern Shore. I am also a NOAA EPP/MSI Graduate Fellow, selected as a part of the inaugural class of 2021. My dissertation research, titled: “Evaluating Physiological and Immune Responses of Tanner Crab (Chionoecetes bairdi) to Hematodinium sp. Infection” seeks to understand the effect of Hematodinium (parasitic dinoflagellate) on gene expression, immune response, immune function as well as metabolic function in Tanner crab. I am passionate about improving my knowledge as a bioinformatics scientist and applying this unique skill set to my work in interdisciplinary scientific research aimed to answer complex scientific questions and problems. As a STEM professional and woman of color, I believe heavily in representation, education/outreach, and bridging the communication gap between scientists and the general public. Activities that interest me in my down time include: hiking, yoga, board games, spending time outdoors, museums, road-trips, traveling, and any opportunity to learn something new. I am a visitor of the Roberts lab twice over, once in the summer of 2019 and again during 2022. I have felt nothing but welcomed and included during my visits to the Roberts lab. This is a diverse and dynamic lab group that encourages professional and personal development of its members and visitors.\n\n\nCeleste Valdivia\nLab notebook | cvaldi@uw.edu\n\nAlthough growing up in San Diego, CA meant that I spent many days of my youth out in the ocean, my scientific interest in the aquatic environment and it’s species wasn’t fully realized until I began a position in 2018 as an undergraduate research assistant in an aquatic ecotoxicology lab the University of California, Davis. During that time, I completed my undergraduate capstone project analyzing the effects of bifenthrin exposure on the behavior of the federally endangered Delta Smelt. After graduating with a bachelor of science in Animal Biology in 2020, I continued my research work in that same lab for an additional two years and further explored the developmental, behavioral, and reproductive impacts several commonly employed urban and agricultural pyrethroids had on native Californian estuarine fish species. In 2022, I dually joined the Gardell Lab at the University of Washington, Tacoma and the Roberts Lab housed in the School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences (SAFS) at the University of Washington, Seattle. As a graduate student at SAFS, I am now focused on identifying the constraints on in vitro cellular immortality in the marine model invertebrate, Botryllus schlosseri. This exploratory process will primarily involve the implementation of procedures for systematic primary cell culture optimization, stress-induced mutagenesis, and bioinformatic network analysis. In my free time I enjoy cooking, tending to my mini indoor garden, and playing guitar.

My research leverages state-of-the-art genomics tools to study environment-physiology interactions within marine organisms, with a particular emphasis on the molecular mechanisms that make aquaculture species within Washington State resilient to environmental change. Through my work I routinely conduct field and laboratory experiments to generate large-scale ‘omics’ datasets (e.g. epigenomics, proteomics, and metabolomics) that can be used to characterize the genetic diversity present within natural populations. This work serves to inform conservation efforts and the development of criteria for broodstock selection within the aquaculture industry to esnure the continued sustainable production of seafood within the United States. To process these diverse datasets, I develop and implement bioinformatics pipelines for data normalization, statistical analyses, and biological pathway analyses. I use an open access online lab notebook and GitHub to publicly share my analyses and support reproducibility. To achieve my research and education outreach aims I collaborate with commercial, tribal, and governmental fisheries organizations, and actively participate in outreach media development. I also regularly take advantage of the amazing hiking and boating activities that Pacific Northwest has to offer with my wife and two-year-old son.\n\n\nAriana S. Huffmyer, PhD\nLab notebook | CV | Twitter: @Dr_Cnidariana | ORCID iD | ashuffmyer@uri.edu | National Science Foundation Ocean Sciences Postdoctoral Fellow | UW eScience Data Science Postdoctoral Fellow |\n\nI am a postdoctoral researcher working with Dr. Hollie Putnam at the University of Rhode Island and Dr. Steven Roberts at the University of Washington studying the effects of climate change on marine invertebrate early life history, with a particular interest in the formation of coral-algal symbiosis during coral development.\nMy current research interests are in understanding how climate change affects coral performance and survival using multi-omic approaches. Increased frequency and severtity of marine heat waves is causing coral bleaching - the breakdown of the nutritional symbiosis between tropical corals and their algal endosymbionts. My research inveistigates the formation of symbiosis between corals and their algal symbionts during early development in coral species in Hawaii, USA and Moorea, French Polynesia by utilizing energetic, metabolomic, and transcriptomic approaches.\nI am working with the E5 Coral team to examine coral physiological, metabolic, and epigenetic responses across nutrient gradients in Moorea. I use online notebooks and GitHub to publicly share my data and analyses.\nI completed my Ph.D. in marine biology at the Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology in the Coral Resilience Lab - The Legacy of Ruth Gates and Lemus Labs where I studied how early life stages of corals respond to climate change driven thermal stress. My work investigated the influence of nutrition and thermal conditioning, and intraspecific interactions on thermal tolerance of coral recruits and how we can leverage this knowledge to enhance coral propagation. My collaborators and I used approaches ranging from field observations to confocal microscopy and energetics and phsyiology. Seeing a need for scientists to also be translators and educators, I conducted research in science education to understand how participation in research influences science identity development.\nOutside the lab, I enjoy hiking, mountain biking, fly fishing, and exploring with my two dogs the Pacific Northwest.\n\n\n\nLarken Root\nLab notebook | CV | larker@uw.edu\n\nI am currently working as a Cooperative Institute for Climate, Ocean, & Ecosystem Studies (CICOES) Fellow in the Roberts Lab in collaboration with Mackenzie Gavery at the NOAA Northwest Fisheries Science Center and Ryan Crim at the Puget Sound Restoration Fund to assess the potential impacts of ocean acidification (OA) on native Pacific Littleneck Clams and naturalized Manila Clams. Specifically, we will determine the physiological impact of OA conditions on adult clams and determine how this impacts reproduction by assessing reproductive success as well as gene expression in gametes. Larvae collected from clams will also be used to determine transgenerational effects on the capacity of larvae to tolerate the same OA conditions by assessing growth performance and gene expression. Results from these experiments are intentionally aimed at expanding the portfolio of options for Puget Sound shellfish growers, and I will be involved in surveying growers to determine the applicability of the methods we develop on clam production. I am also active in a separate project to identify and then silence genes expressed in the development of germ line cells in shellfish embryos, with the ultimate goal of establishing a method for producing sterile shellfish for use in aquaculture.\nI have a background in comparative physiology having completed a dissertation comparing the molecular response of two species of tilapia to increased environmental salinity levels. This research including transcriptomic and proteomic analysis of the main tissues responsible for ion balance (gill and kidney). This work was also aimed at aiding aquaculture producers by allowing them to use partial seawater in tilapia ponds and reduce the use of freshwater, especially in areas which have scarce freshwater resources.\nWhen not doing research, I am an avid hiker, and I enjoy a number of hobbies including woodworking, playing musical instruments, baking, and playing with my dogs Nimbus and Pepita.\n\n\n\nResearch Scientists\n\nSam White\nLab notebook | Email Sam\n\nI am a research scientist in the lab since the lab’s inception in 2007 and am jack-of-all-trades lab member. I dabble in all aspects of helping the lab run efficiently (bionformatics, computer/server maintenance, training new personnel, purchasing/reconciliation, safety documentation/training, etc), but as a molecular biologist by training (B.S. Univ. of Illinois @ Urbana-Champaign - Plant Biology; M.S. Arizona State Univerity - Plant Biology), I excel at bench work.\nOutside of lab-related work, I dig playing video games and listening to Phish (and, to placate the haters, I also like other good bands/musicians like Queens of the Stone Age, Uriah Heep, and Kacey Musgraves). I guess I also enjoy spending time with my spouse, kid, and dog, too.\n\nBrent Vadopalas\nGiles Goetz\nDelaney Lawson\n\n\n\nUndergraduate Students\nHenry Berg  Eric Essington  Dorothy Lartey\n\n\nAlumni\n\n\nPostdoctoral Research Associates\nShelly Wanamaker\nHollie Putnam\n\n\nResearch Scientists\nKaitlyn Mitchell\nCrystal Simchick\n\n\nGraduate Students\nYaamini Venkataraman\nLaura Spencer\nGrace Crandall\nJay Dimond\nMegan Hintz\nRhonda Elliot\nJake Heare\nAndy Jasonowicz\nClaire Olson\nMackenzie Gavery\nEmma Timmins-Schiffman\nDoug Immerman\nCaroline Storer\nDave Metzger\n\n\n\nUndergraduates\nDelaney Lawson (2022) proposal paper presentation\nHana Ra (2020)\nRonit (pre-college) (2019)\nAlanna Greene (2019)\nGrace Crandall (2016) proposal paper slides presentation notebook\nJonathan Allen UW (2016) proposal paper slides presentation notebook\nMrunmayee Manohar Shete (2015) notebook\nKatie Jackson UW SAFS (2015)\nJoelle Blaise UW SAFS (2014)\nHannah Wear; UW SAFS (2013-2014) proposal paper poster notebook\nCharles Duber; UW SAFS (2013-2014) proposal paper slides notebook\nJessica Blanchette; UW SAFS (2013-2014) proposal paper slides notebook\n\nBradley Chi; UW SAFS proposal paper slides\nPaul Ehlen; UW FISH499 blog slides\nHarry Podschwit; UW notebook\nDerek Brady; UW SAFS proposal paper slides\nManel Khan; UW notebook\nDavid Berman; UW SAFS proposal paper\nHerschel Cox; UW SAFS proposal paper\nLexie Miller; UW FISH499 paper \nJason Tayag; UW SAFS proposal paper slides\nSonia Albin; UW SAFS proposal paper slides\nZac Halls; UW notebook\nAmanda Davis FISH499; UW paper\nChristina Miller FISH498; UW notebook\nRony Thi; UW notebook\nAnna Fabrizio; UW SAFS proposal | paper | presentation\nKevin Jeong; UW FISH499 notebook\nRachel Thompson; UW SAFS proposal | paper | slides\nLeslie Jensen; UW SAFS proposal | paper | slides | video\nChristin McLemore; UW SAFS proposal | paper | slides | video\nTatyana Marushchak; UW Chemistry project\nStephannie Spurr; UW SAFS paper | 499\nKatie Fulkerson; UW SAFS proposal | paper | presentation\nCullen Taplin; UW SAFS proposal | paper | presentation\nJuliann Clark; UW project\nTushara Saint Vitus; UW SAFS project\nLindsay Braun; Santa Clara University project\nMairead Bermingham; N Univ of Ireland, Cork project\nZachary Schiller; Tufts University project\n\n\n\nVisiting Scientists\nJavier A.
