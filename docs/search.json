    "text": "Summary\nResearchers at the Alaska Fisheries Science Center (AFSC) and the University of Washington are interested in the effects of ocean acidification (OA) on commercially and economically important crab and fish species. It appears that many species are negatively affected by exposure to pH levels predicted to occur throughout their ranges under climate change.  The effects of OA include physiological consequences including decreased growth, altered embryonic development, reduced exoskeleton strength, increased metabolic rate, altered immune system, altered behavior, and increased mortality.  Environmental changes may select for adapted individuals, resulting in populations that are less vulnerable to OA than the current population. Estimating the degree to which acclimation and adaptation will alter the experimental effects of OA and combined effects with other stressors is thus critical to accurately predicting how these stressors will affect future fisheries yields.  We are using next-generation sequencing techniques to identify the specific alterations in the molecular, metabolic, and physiological pathways of individuals exposed to OA. We are looking for a post-doctoral researcher to perform bioinformatics on RNA transcriptomic data of Pacific cod and crabs exposed to OA conditions in an experimental setting. In addition, the researcher will be responsible for writing up their methods and results and drafting peer-reviewed manuscripts."

    "text": "Summary\nAquaculture operations serve as a vital cog in our local economy, playing an integral role in conservation efforts and holding cultural significance. Primarily, my laboratory’s research program is devoted to enhancing aquaculture practices in the Pacific Northwest, having received several research awards in collaboration with tribes, industry players, and conservation organizations.\nDespite having various projects involving shellfish transfer to the field for commercial or conservation purposes, budget constraints and directives in specific Requests for Proposals (RFPs) have hindered us from leveraging these opportunities to engage students and staff in fieldwork components. Thus, the purpose of this proposal is to request funds that would facilitate student and staff involvement in ongoing field grow-outs, thereby creating unique opportunities for SAFS community members. The funding will cover travel expenses, field sampling, and reagents and equipment for physiological analysis.\nOur partnerships span both local and regional scopes, enabling a range of experiences. For instance, local sites include shellfish farms in Puget Sound, as well as with sites associated with the MusselWatch program via UW Tacoma. These local sites provide a platform for integrating field research into courses like FISH 441/541 Integrative Environmental Physiology. Traditionally, the lab has exclusively engaged in lab-based environmental manipulation. However, this funding would enable us to shift focus to comparative studies across different field sites, offering students a more immersive experience in data collection and physiological assessment. Additionally, students would gain the invaluable experience of observing active aquaculture operations, providing them with practical insights into the application of their classroom knowledge. With some necessary constraints, students would be given the freedom to design their experiments. For instance, they could assess the stress response in oysters from two different field sites, formulating hypotheses to test based on natural conditions.\nMoreover, as part of a recent USDA award, we are dispatching oysters to commercial producers in Oregon. These field sites would provide an excellent framework for studies, which may be more apt for graduate students or scientific staff due to the need for accommodation. This experience would also illuminate the variations in environmental conditions and aquaculture practices across the region, fostering the expansion of research networks for our students."

    "text": "Summary\nChanging climate conditions, due to increasing releases of CO2 into the atmosphere, are causing warming of the world’s oceans. Changes in seawater temperatures are predicted to cause a shift in the distribution and a change in the abundance of most plants and animals. For most species, the magnitude of the impact, the potential for adaptation to future temperatures, and the mechanisms for adaptation are unknown. Features of parasite/disease ecology are also predicted to change as oceans warm, including susceptibility of hosts to disease, host ability to combat disease once infected, and alterations in pathogen virulence. Alaskan Tanner crab stocks, supporting fisheries worth $21 million in 2014, are expected to be significantly impacted directly and indirectly by warming temperatures. The Alaska Department of Fish and Game considers bitter crab disease, caused by a parasitic dinoflagellate, Hematodinium, to be the ‘principle threat’ to Alaskan Tanner crab stocks. Infection rates in the Bering Sea and southeast Alaska range from 2-5% and 0-100%, respectively. In heavily infected hosts, the meat is soft and chalky with a bitter taste, rendering the crabs unmarketable. The disease is believed fatal, although the time from infection to death remains uncertain. Recent worldwide spread of Hematodinium infections appears to have closely followed warming trends in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. We postulate that increased temperature in the North Pacific will physiologically stress Tanner crabs and also lead to increased prevalence of Hematodinium infections, either of which may lead to increased mortality in Tanner crabs. We propose to hold healthy and Hematodinium-infected Tanner crabs under different temperature regimes testing for a genetic response to infection and temperature. Our research will provide insight into the underlying mechanistic linkages between potential effects of climate change and important processes such as recruitment, growth and natural mortality on Alaskan Tanner crab stocks."

In particular, overwintering success of juveniles is hypothesized to represent a critical bottleneck with food availability the previous summer affecting juvenile lipid reserves and thus, their ability to survive winter. The physiological and transcriptional responses of Pacific cod and whether selective mortality is present under thermal stress are unknown. The proposed project will address these questions critical to their survival under climate change by identifying regions of the genome and epigenome that respond to thermal stress and starvation. Juvenile Pacific cod will be reared in three temperatures under feeding and non-feeding conditions, then an integrated genomic approach will identify genes, gene variants, and epigenetic markers that respond to thermal stress and confer resilience. To complement the genomic approaches and further investigate temperature influences on energy resources, we will perform lipid analyses. This work will inform predictions of genetic selection and molecular response of Pacific cod in the Gulf of Alaska under climate change."

The specific research and outreach objectives we will use to achieve this goal are:\nObjective 1. Determine susceptibility of Washington shellfish farms to heatwaves. Air and water temperatures experienced by oysters during grow-out will be monitored at farms within the Salish Sea and Willapa Bay in collaboration with industry partners. Continuous monitoring of environmental conditions in combination with oyster mortality data will be used to generate a climate risk assessment model for commercial growing areas within Washington State.\nObjective 2. Develop a commercially viable hatchery husbandry protocol that improves oyster heat tolerance. Oyster seed (“spat”) from OsHV-1 resistant families supplied by the USDA-ARS’ Pacific Shellfish Breeding Center (PSBC) will undergo sublethal exposure to simulated marine and aerial heat waves within a hatchery setting. The summer survival of stress-primed spat out-planted at farms with Puget Sound and Willapa Bay will inform the creation of a husbandry protocol that improves oyster climate resilience.\nObjective 3. Develop an enhanced workforce training curriculum for shellfish industry technicians. To address the industry’s need for skilled technicians, students from Bellingham Technical College’s (BTC) Fisheries and Aquaculture Sciences Program will be integrated into research objectives; this collaboration will be used to generate an enhanced workforce training curriculum that uses OsHV-1 and heat waves as case studies. Students will also gain exposure to training opportunities by serving as hatchery technicians, summer interns at shellfish farms, and student ambassadors during regular partner meetings."

Shellfish aquaculture is one of the most economically important sectors of the US industry, with major species including oysters and clams. As is the case with all farmed species, there are a suite of desirable phenotypes that directly correspond to increased environmental and economic sustainability. The ability to identify genomic predictors of phenotype offer a framework to increase aquaculture production. In shellfish aquaculture key phenotypes continue to be resilience and stress tolerance. Understanding the physiological underpinnings of these phenotypes in oysters and clams has been a focus in our group. To this end we have archived hundreds of samples from families with diverse phenotypic responses to stress. For example, as part of one effort to examine the influence of ploidy on oyster stress tolerance we have Standard Metabolic Rate (SMR) and enzyme activity data on oysters that reveal diverse physiological profiles. In response to the NRSP-8 Small Funding Possibilities for US Aquaculture Groups, we are proposing to 1) identify genomic architecture variation contributing to desired phenotypes in shellfish and 2) develop a community platform to share data and analytical approaches. These objectives are in direct response to Program Objective 2: Advance genome-to-phenome prediction by implementing strategies and tools to identify and validate genes and allelic variants predictive of biologically and economically important phenotypes and traits. Additionally the proposed work will address Program Objective 1, by … providing a deep functional annotation of assemblies, and comparison across species to understand structure and function of animal genomes."

Innovative scientific solutions are required to meet these ongoing and future challenges. In this project, we will add capacity to collaborative research between partners at the University of Washington and the Northwest Fisheries Science Center, addressing objectives of key importance to the National Marine Fisheries Service mission. These include innovative problem-solving approaches to address challenges facing sustainable aquaculture development, understanding the impacts of climate variability on marine fish and shellfish, and woven throughout these research activities is the development of ’omics and bioinformatics workflows for both data generation and data analysis (bioinformatics). Through this composite project, our goal is to contribute to applications to support sustainable aquaculture, increase our understanding of the effects of OA on marine fish and shellfish and contribute bioinformatic capacity, tools and workflows for research related to aquaculture, genomics and climate change."

We will test and implement shellfish performance enhancement methods through the use of environmental stressor preconditioning, or “hardening”. The objectives of this work are to A) Identify key stages in the geoduck life cycle when environmental conditioning can be applied for optimal benefits to productivity, including: – Broodstock conditioning and reproductive performance, – Larval growth and survivorship, and – Juvenile resistance to stress through repeated exposures, B) Use genomics and epigenomics to identify underlying mechanisms involved in enhanced performance. This will provide mechanistic information that enables the application of optimal preconditioning approaches in other shellfish species. This project directly addresses the research topics of genomics, quantitative genetics, and phenomics in the less studied, yet viable, geoduck clam. The proposed work is based on our group’s prior finding that some exposure to low pH conditions can improve larval and juvenile performance traits. The research proposed will integrate and further test these findings in a commercial shellfish hatchery setting and determine the genetic and epigenetic markers associated with improved performance. In addition, we will explore how the “memory” of prior exposure increases later performance such that epigenetic markers could be leveraged in broodstock management and hatchery practices. A number of phenotypes will be assessed, as well as the underlying genomic factors, including fecundity, survival, and growth."

The first step in the process is the identification of genes involved in primordial germ cell (PGC) specification in bivalves via single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA- Seq). This cutting-edge technique is particularly suited to identify germ cell markers in bivalves, since germ cell precursors represent a small number of cells in developing embryos. This information is integral to being able to control germ cell fate for reproductive sterilization of aquaculture species, and our proposed use of scRNA-Seq for directed application to aquaculture is both novel and potentially highly beneficial to the broader shellfish aquaculture community. Our first specific research aim is to characterize genomic processes involved in germ cell specification in Pacific oysters. A second fundamental step in the process is the optimization of techniques to deliver targeted, gene-regulating molecules to embryos to inhibit germ cell formation. Methods to optimize delivery techniques, including the use of CRISPR-Cas9 and morpholino constructs, have yet to be developed for bivalve embryos. Therefore, our second specific research aim is to optimize delivery techniques of custom gene-regulating molecules to oyster embryos. The completion of these objectives sets the stage for a more effective and sustainable approach for sterilization of shellfish."

Covid-19 has offered us an unprecedented glimpse into the challenges students face in the K-12 education system. It has also profoundly impacted socio-economically disadvantaged communities through the exposure of crippled or missing infrastructure. These same communities have been deliberately disconnected from building relationships with the natural world. In the face of complex problems like climate change, which will disproportionately impact these communities, we must act urgently to support the students who have historically been excluded from environmental science education. Our project starts with reconnecting community to environment, followed by engaging learners dynamically through the co-production of place-based knowledge. Although disadvantaged communities are highly engaged in climate change mitigation, this is often limited to anecdotes about water quality during trash pick-ups or community beautification projects led by outside non-profit volunteers, rather than building knowledge and strength within the community. Rarely do students have the opportunity to access their local environment through a non- problem solving lens and participate as equal partners. We want to change who is leading the learning as well as how the learning is done. Partnering with Sea Potential and Black in Marine Science, our team of scientists and digital arts experts will co-produce an arts based learning approach to increase environmental literacy in the communities most regularly overlooked. We will empower students to engage with the intertidal ecosystem, a defining feature of all coastlines and an accessible and dynamic place to learn about ocean science, organismal resilience, and community composition. Student projects will demonstrate how they understand the intertidal ecosystem, their connection to it, and its relationship to their home neighborhoods. Each of the projects will be presented to their academic and familial communities as well as used to create a teaching toolkit for local and national educators to replicate our art- and science-integrated student centered learning model for intertidal ecology."

The specific objectives include 1) Characterize carryover performance in clams in response to ocean acidification, 2) Identify maternal macromolecule contribution of intergenerational plasticity and carryover performance, 3) Identify paternal epigenetic signatures associated with intergenerational plasticity and carryover performance, and 4) Develop inclusive educational experiences and products for underserved groups. The proposed work supports Washington Sea Grants commitment to cultivating partnerships and practicing a commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion. The objectives directly align with the critical program areas of Sustainable Fisheries and Aquaculture, Ocean Literacy and Workforce Development, and Healthy Coastal Ecosystems."

    "text": "Summary\nGiven the supreme importance of maintaining ecological security in expanding shellfish farming to meet the global demand for environmentally sustainable protein, our goal is to engage a novel mix of disciplines to create new knowledge leading to an optimal approach for conferring sterility in emerging shellfish species. We have assembled an interdisciplinary team including aquaculture specialists, molecular physiologists, and single cell genomicists to tackle the critical initial step in this approach: the identification of genes involved in germ cell fate at the earliest developmental stages in geoducks. We anticipate identifying several germ cell- specific genes that when disrupted effectively turn off germ cell differentiation, yielding sterile products that do not undergo gonadogenesis, exhibit superior performance, and cannot disrupt genetic structure of ecosystems. Identification of these genes will be the measure of success for the proposed work. These gene targets will be the focus of future stages of research that determines how to best disrupt reproductive function without impacting growth performance."

Plus, the diploids and triploids weren’t the same treatment types (i.e. the diploids were poly:IC-injected, whereas the triploids were controls - so they weren’t really comparable). So, Steven asked that I find comparable set of samples so that we’d have either diploid controls or triploids which were poly:IC-injected. Looking in the freezer box for samples (Google sheet), I found four diploid MgCl2 control RNA samples. Before starting reverse transcription, I felt it would be best to quantify the RNA using the Qubit 3.0 using the Broad Range Assay.

    "section": "",
    "text": "We are thrilled to share our latest research paper, “Population-specific effects of ocean acidification in the Olympia oyster,” authored by Laura H Spencer, Steven B Roberts, and Katherine Silliman. The study has recently been published in bioRxiv and sheds light on the mechanisms underlying population-specific responses of Olympia oysters (Ostrea lurida) to ocean acidification. This research is groundbreaking in illustrating how different populations of the same species can exhibit varying levels of resilience to environmental stressors like acidification, a crucial factor for both conservation and marine food system sustainability.\n\n\nOcean acidification is a growing concern that is having a detrimental impact on marine ecosystems globally. The increased levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere are dissolving into our oceans, lowering their pH levels. Marine organisms like oysters are particularly vulnerable to such changes, as they rely on carbonate ions to build their shells. Understanding how different populations of marine species respond to this issue is key for effective conservation strategies and sustainable marine food systems.\n\n\n\nThe study focused on three phenotypically distinct populations of Olympia oysters from Dabob Bay, Fidalgo Bay, and Oyster Bay, bred and reared in common conditions over four years. The team assessed various aspects such as growth, reproductive development, and transcriptional responses to ocean acidification within and across these populations.\n\n\n\n\nDabob Bay Population: Exhibited the slowest growth but had high survival rates. This population also mounted the largest transcriptional response to acidification without affecting its growth and reproduction.\nFidalgo Bay Population: Exhibited the fastest growth rate but had the lowest fecundity. This population showed a moderate transcriptional response to acidification.\nOyster Bay Population: Had the highest fecundity but the lowest survival rates. Interestingly, this population did not respond at the transcript level and was the only group where acidification negatively affected growth and reproductive development.\nNext Generation Impact: Acidification did not affect gene expression in the larval stage for any population, although the Oyster Bay population produced larger larvae, which might partly mitigate the negative effects of acidification.\n\n\n\n\nThe findings are revolutionary for several reasons:\n\nConservation Implications: Populations with distinct resilience levels offer natural reservoirs of biodiversity that can be targeted for conservation efforts.\nFood System Sustainability: Understanding population-specific traits can help in developing more resilient aquaculture practices.\nGenetic Insights: The study identified specific genes in the Dabob Bay population related to antibacterial and antiviral processes, metabolism, growth, and reproduction, providing crucial clues into the mechanisms of stress tolerance.\nMicroscale Variability: The research underscores that distinct physiotypes can exist among marine invertebrate populations even on small geographic scales, which has far-reaching implications for species resilience to environmental stressors.\n\n\n\n\nThe research paves the way for future studies that can focus on leveraging these population-specific responses for the betterment of marine ecosystems and human needs. The identified genetic markers can also be used in selective breeding programs to improve resilience against ocean acidification.\n\n\nLaura H Spencer, Steven B Roberts, Katherine Silliman, “Population-specific effects of ocean acidification in the Olympia oyster,” bioRxiv 2023.09.08.556443; doi: 10.1101/2023.09.08.556443\nFeel free to dive into the full paper for a more detailed understanding of our findings."

The identified genetic markers can also be used in selective breeding programs to improve resilience against ocean acidification.\n\n\nLaura H Spencer, Steven B Roberts, Katherine Silliman, “Population-specific effects of ocean acidification in the Olympia oyster,” bioRxiv 2023.09.08.556443; doi: 10.1101/2023.09.08.556443\nFeel free to dive into the full paper for a more detailed understanding of our findings."

    "text": "This is an excerpt from a feature on the SAFS website. Please read the full article here.\n\nMarine science mentoring over the summer at FHL\nSpending the summer at Friday Harbor Labs (FHL), SAFS grad student Chris Mantegna mentored four students – two as part of the NSF-funded Research Experience for Undergrads-Blinks (REU) program and two as part of the Doris Duke Conservation Scholars Program (DDCSP). During the program, students get to collaborate on a research project with their scientist-mentor to build marine research skills.\nSpecifically geared towards enhancing diversity within the marine sciences, the program welcomes students from underrepresented groups. This year, Chris’ students came from institutions across the US, including Kentucky, Massachusetts, Vermont and North Carolina, to work with her on an intertidal monitoring survey on Yellow Island in the Salish Sea.\n\n\n\nOchre sea stars (Pisaster ocherous) found on the island at low tide.\n\n\nThe REU-Blinks program based out of FHL takes advantage of the pristine environment, remarkable biodiversity, and the scientific and technical resources available at the marine science research facility. The DDCSP program aims to increase diversity in conservation work and allows students from all over the US a chance to participate in a two-year program where second year scholars participate in an onsite internship of their choosing.\nYellow Island is a nature preserve that The Nature Conservancy purchased in 1980, that also doubles up as a marine reserve, with no boating or fishing allowed within 300 yards of the island. The island is being used by Chris and the research team as a proxy for health in the wider Salish Sea due to the lack of human disturbance.\nAs part of a wider program sponsored by Black In Marine Science(BIMS) and The Nature Conservancy, Chris restarted a monitoring project to get a better idea of the biodiversity on the island, and this kicked off last year in 2022 with a pilot program nailing down methods for collecting data. This year, with her mentees, the team collected a full season of data, complemented with eDNA work.\ncontinue reading here."

    "section": "",
    "text": "The issue of climate change and its cascading effects on marine ecosystems is a growing concern for researchers, conservationists, and policymakers alike. One of the intriguing avenues of research in marine science involves the impact of polyploidy, a genetic variation where organisms have extra sets of chromosomes, on stress tolerance in marine species. A recent study led by Matthew N. George from the School of Aquatic & Fishery Sciences at the University of Washington, along with affiliations from the Environmental and Fisheries Sciences Division at the Northwest Fisheries Science Center, sheds new light on the vulnerability of triploid Pacific oysters to climate stressors.\n\n\n\nThe study, titled “Triploid Pacific oysters exhibit stress response dysregulation and elevated mortality following heatwaves,” focuses on the comparison of diploid (2n) and triploid (3n) Pacific oysters (Crassostrea gigas) in response to environmental conditions akin to a heatwave. By exposing these oysters to different stressors such as elevated seawater temperature and aerial emersion, the researchers found that triploid oysters had a significantly higher mortality rate than their diploid counterparts when subjected to multiple stressors.\n\n\n\nHigher Mortality Rates in Triploids: The mortality rate in triploid oysters exposed to multiple stressors was 36.4% compared to 14.8% in diploid oysters.\nMetabolic and Physiological Limitations: Triploid oysters showed signs of metabolic depression, a reduction in ctenidium Na+/K+ ATPase activity, and dysregulated expression of stress response genes.\nFunctional Genomics Insights: Gene sets enriched in biological processes like metabolism, stress tolerance, and immune function were disproportionately represented in triploids across stress treatments.\n\n\n\n\nThe increased vulnerability of triploid Pacific oysters to climate stressors has far-reaching implications. Triploidy is often induced to achieve reproductive control in species used for marine aquaculture. While this serves to boost production and control unwanted reproduction, the study highlights that it may also render these organisms more susceptible to environmental extremes. This, in turn, could impact food security in regions dependent on marine aquaculture.\n\n\n\n\nThe findings of this study present a clear need for further research to fully understand the complexities of triploidy and its relationship with environmental stress tolerance. As climate change continues to bring about more frequent and severe heatwaves, understanding the impact on marine organisms is crucial. Future research should explore the possibility of developing stress-resilient triploid species and consider alternative strategies for reproductive control in aquaculture.\n\n\n\nWhile triploidy offers some benefits for controlling reproduction in marine aquaculture, this genetic modification may inadvertently make these organisms more susceptible to the threats posed by climate change. As we continue to grapple with the realities of a changing climate, research like this serves as an invaluable resource for better understanding the complex interactions between genetic variation and environmental stressors, thereby informing both conservation strategies and aquaculture practices.\n\n\n\nGeorge, M.

    "text": "In the process of generating expression matrices for CEABIGR (GitHub repo), and in turn distance matrices for these samples, I realized a couple of things:\n\nDESeq2 has a function (assay()) that will automatically calculate/produce the distance matrices I want.\nStringTie comes with a script (prepDE.py3) which will spit out expression matrices formatted for import into DESeq2.\n\nSo, this should be easy, right? Of course not. LOL. When trying to run the StringTie prepDE.py3 script on the original output from Stringtie on 20220225 (notebook), I encountered a parsing error for the very first GTF file it encountered. Considering the GTF file(s) was/are generated by StringTie, it seemed odd that it wouldn’t be able to parse the GTF. Doing some investigating, I came across a number of issues in the Stringtie GitHub repo indicating that using a version of Stringtie (e.g. &lt;v2.2.0), with a certain combination of arguments (specifically, the -e argument seemed potentially problematic) could create various errors if using that output with an updated version of StringTie. Well, I was doing just that! Was it causing the parsing error I was experiencing? Don’t know, but I’d also like to avoid the other downstream errors potentially associated with the output(s) from the older version of Stringtie, so I’ve decided to re-run the analysis using a the most current version of StringTie.\nI used the trimmed RNAseq reads from 20220224 (notebook). I also needed to identify alternative transcripts in the Crassostrea virginica (Eastern oyster) gonad RNAseq data we have. I previously used HISAT2 to index the NCBI Crassostrea virginica (Eastern oyster) genome and identify exon/splice sites on 20210720.

Here’s a description of all the file types found in each directory:\n\n*.ctab: See ballgown documentation for description of these.\n*.checksums.md5: MD5 checksums for all files in each directory.\n*.cov_refs.gtf: Coverage GTF generate by StringTie and used to generate final GTF for each sample.\n*.gtf: Final GTF file produced by StringTie for each sample.\n*_hisat2.err: Standard error output from HISAT2. Contains alignment info.\n*.sorted.bam: Sorted BAM alignments file produced by HISAT2.\n*.sorted.bam.bai: BAM index file.\n\nThe initial alignments from 20210726 which accidentally used untrimmed sequencing reads had some truly abysmal alignment rates (males were ~30% and females were around 45%). This round is a marked improvement. The females exhibit alignment rates around what one would expect (&gt; 80%), while the males, even though relatively low (around 57%), it is drasticalliy better than the 30% seen when using the untrimmed reads. Still, the alignment rates are consistently low/lower in males, compared to the females. Not sure of what this means, but exploring some additional avenues to investigate (e.g. possible residual rRNA, possible contamination with other organismal RNA)\nHere’s a table. The letter M or F in the sample name column indicates sex.\n\n\n\nSample\nAlignment Rate\n\n\n\n\nS12M\n58.09%\n\n\nS13M\n58.44%\n\n\nS16F\n81.08%\n\n\nS19F\n82.05%\n\n\nS22F\n82.16%\n\n\nS23M\n57.06%\n\n\nS29F\n75.92%\n\n\nS31M\n61.12%\n\n\nS35F\n81.95%\n\n\nS36F\n80.60%\n\n\nS39F\n82.52%\n\n\nS3F\n82.31%\n\n\nS41F\n78.38%\n\n\nS44F\n78.70%\n\n\nS48M\n57.60%\n\n\nS50F\n82.96%\n\n\nS52F\n73.20%\n\n\nS53F\n81.48%\n\n\nS54F\n77.75%\n\n\nS59M\n65.81%\n\n\nS64M\n71.53%\n\n\nS6M\n57.82%\n\n\nS76F\n82.82%\n\n\nS77F\n84.37%\n\n\nS7M\n58.74%\n\n\nS9M\n57.95%\n\n\n\nAs

Environmental and species-specific microbiomes are instrumental in maintaining ecosystem and host health, respectively. The introduction of pathogenic microbes that shift microbiome community structure can lead to illness and death. Understanding the dynamics of microbiomes across a diversity of environments and hosts will help us to better understand which taxa forecast survival and which forecast mortality events. Results We characterized the bacterial community microbiome in the water of a commercial shellfish hatchery in Washington state, USA, where the hatchery has been plagued by recurring and unexplained larval mortality events. By applying the complementary methods of metagenomics and metaproteomics we were able to more fully characterize the bacterial taxa in the hatchery at high (pH 8.2) and low (pH 7.1) pH that were metabolically active versus present but not contributing metabolically. There were shifts in the taxonomy and functional profile of the microbiome between pH and over time. Based on detected metagenomic reads and metaproteomic peptide spectral matches, some taxa were more metabolically active than expected based on presence alone (Deltaproteobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria) and some were less metabolically active than expected (e.g., Betaproteobacteria, Cytophagia). There was little correlation between potential and realized metabolic function based on Gene Ontology analysis of detected genes and peptides. Conclusion The complementary methods of metagenomics and metaproteomics contribute to a more full characterization of bacterial taxa that are potentially active versus truly metabolically active and thus impact water quality and inter-trophic relationships."

    "text": "Abstract\nThe blue mussel Mytilus chilensis is an endemic and key socioeconomic species inhabiting the southern coast of Chile. This bivalve species supports a booming aquaculture industry, which entirely relies on artificially collected seeds from natural beds that are translocated to diverse physical–chemical ocean farming conditions. Furthermore, mussel production is threatened by a broad range of microorganisms, pollution, and environmental stressors that eventually impact its survival and growth. Herein, understanding the genomic basis of the local adaption is pivotal to developing sustainable shellfish aquaculture. We present a high-quality reference genome of M. chilensis, which is the first chromosome-level genome for a Mytilidae member in South America. The assembled genome size was 1.93 Gb, with a contig N50 of 134 Mb. Through Hi-C proximity ligation, 11,868 contigs were clustered, ordered, and assembled into 14 chromosomes in congruence with the karyological evidence. The M. chilensis genome comprises 34,530 genes and 4795 non-coding RNAs. A total of 57% of the genome contains repetitive sequences with predominancy of LTR-retrotransposons and unknown elements. Comparative genome analysis of M. chilensis and M. coruscus was conducted, revealing genic rearrangements distributed into the whole genome. Notably, transposable Steamer-like elements associated with horizontal transmissible cancer were explored in reference genomes, suggesting putative relationships at the chromosome level in Bivalvia. Genome expression analysis was also conducted, showing putative genomic differences between two ecologically different mussel populations. The evidence suggests that local genome adaptation and physiological plasticity can be analyzed to develop sustainable mussel production. The genome of M. chilensis provides pivotal molecular knowledge for the Mytilus complex."

    "text": "Abstract\nPacific oysters (Crassostrea gigas) are a valuable aquaculture product that provides important ecosystem benefits. Among other threats, climate-driven changes in ocean temperature can impact oyster metabolism, survivorship, and immune function. We investigated how elevated temperature impacts larval oysters during settlement (19–33 days post-fertilization), using shotgun proteomics with data-independent acquisition to identify proteins present in the oysters after 2 weeks of exposure to 23 °C or 29 °C. Oysters maintained at elevated temperatures were larger and had a higher settlement rate, with 86% surviving to the end of the experiment; these oysters also had higher abundance trends of proteins related to metabolism and growth. Oysters held at 23 °C were smaller, had a decreased settlement rate, displayed 100% mortality, and had elevated abundance trends of proteins related to immune response. This novel use of proteomics was able to capture characteristic shifts in protein abundance that hint at important differences in the phenotypic response of Pacific oysters to temperature regimes. Additionally, this work has produced a robust proteomic product that will be the basis for future research on bivalve developmental processes."

    "text": "Abstract\nProjecting ecological and evolutionary responses to variable and changing environments is central to anticipating and managing impacts to biodiversity and ecosystems. Current modeling approaches are largely phenomenological and often fail to accurately project responses due to numerous biological processes at multiple levels of biological organization responding to environmental variation at varied spatial and temporal scales. Limited mechanistic understanding of organismal responses to environmental variability and extremes also restricts predictive capacity. We outline a strategy for identifying and modeling the key organismal mechanisms across levels of biological organization that mediate ecological and evolutionary responses to environmental variation. A central component of this strategy is quantifying timescales and magnitudes of climatic variability and how organisms experience them. We highlight recent empirical research that builds this information and suggest how to design future experiments that can produce more generalizable principles. We discuss how to create biologically informed projections in a feasible way by combining statistical and mechanistic approaches. Predictions will inform both fundamental and practical questions at the interface of ecology, evolution, and Earth science such as how organisms experience, adapt to, and respond to environmental variation at multiple hierarchical spatial and temporal scales."

    "text": "Abstract\nThere is a growing focus on the role of DNA methylation in the ability of marine invertebrates to rapidly respond to changing environmental factors and anthropogenic impacts. However, genome-wide DNA methylation studies in nonmodel organisms are currently hampered by a limited understanding of methodological biases. Here, we compare three methods for quantifying DNA methylation at single base-pair resolution—whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS), reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS), and methyl-CpG binding domain bisulfite sequencing (MBDBS)—using multiple individuals from two reef-building coral species with contrasting environmental sensitivity. All methods reveal substantially greater methylation in Montipora capitata (11.4%) than the more sensitive Pocillopora acuta (2.9%). The majority of CpG methylation in both species occurs in gene bodies and flanking regions. In both species, MBDBS has the greatest capacity for detecting CpGs in coding regions at our sequencing depth, but MBDBS may be influenced by intrasample methylation heterogeneity. RRBS yields robust information for specific loci albeit without enrichment of any particular genome feature and with significantly reduced genome coverage. Relative genome size strongly influences the number and location of CpGs detected by each method when sequencing depth is limited, illuminating nuances in cross-species comparisons. As genome-wide methylation differences, supported by data across bisulfite sequencing methods, may contribute to environmental sensitivity phenotypes in critical marine invertebrate taxa, these data provide a genomic resource for investigating the functional role of DNA methylation in environmental tolerance."

    "text": "Abstract\nAlthough low levels of thermal stress, irradiance and dietary restriction can have beneficial effects for many taxa, stress acclimation remains little studied in marine invertebrates, even though they are threatened by climate change stressors such as ocean acidification. To test the role of life-stage and stress-intensity dependence in eliciting enhanced tolerance under subsequent stress encounters, we initially conditioned pediveliger Pacific geoduck (Panopea generosa) larvae to ambient and moderately elevated PCO2 (920 µatm and 2800 µatm, respectively) for 110 days. Then, clams were exposed to ambient, moderate or severely elevated PCO2 (750, 2800 or 4900 µatm, respectively) for 7 days and, following 7 days in ambient conditions, a 7-day third exposure to ambient (970 µatm) or moderate PCO2 (3000 µatm). Initial conditioning to moderate PCO2 stress followed by second and third exposure to severe and moderate PCO2 stress increased respiration rate, organic biomass and shell size, suggesting a stress-intensity-dependent effect on energetics. Additionally, stress-acclimated clams had lower antioxidant capacity compared with clams under ambient conditions, supporting the hypothesis that stress over postlarval-to-juvenile development affects oxidative status later in life. Time series and stress intensity-specific approaches can reveal life-stages and magnitudes of exposure, respectively, that may elicit beneficial phenotypic variation."

    "text": "Abstract\nPolyploidy has been shown to negatively impact environmental stress tolerance, resulting in increased susceptibility to extreme climate events such as marine heatwaves (MHWs). In this study, we used the response of the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas to MHWs as a model system to identify key ploidy-specific differences in the physiological and transcriptomic response of oysters to environmental stress. In this study, adult diploid (2n) and triploid (3n) oysters were exposed to elevated seawater temperature (single stressor; 30°C), elevated temperature followed by acute desiccation stress (multiple stressor; 30°C + emersion at an aerial temperature of 44°C for 4h), or a control (17°C) within a hatchery setting. Oyster mortality rate was elevated within stress treatments with respect to the control and was significantly higher in triploids than diploids following multiple stress exposure (36.4% vs. 14.8%). Triploids within the multiple stressor treatment exhibited signs of energetic limitation, including metabolic depression, a significant reduction in ctenidium Na+/K+ ATPase activity, and the dysregulated expression of key genes associated with heat tolerance, the inhibition of apoptosis, and mitochondrial function. Functional enrichment analysis of ploidy-specific gene sets identified that biological processes associated with metabolism, stress tolerance, and immune function were overrepresented within triploids across stress treatments. Our results demonstrate that triploidy impacts the transcriptional regulation of key metabolic processes that underly the environmental stress response of Pacific oysters, resulting in downstream shifts in physiological tolerance limits that may be detrimental to survival. The impact of chromosome set manipulation on the climate resilience of marine populations has important implications for the adaptability of marine populations and domestic food security within future climate scenarios, especially as triploidy induction becomes an increasingly popular tool to elicit reproductive control across a wide range of marine organisms used within marine aquaculture."

    "text": "Abstract\nFor ectothermic marine invertebrates living in temperate regions, impacts of ocean warming will vary considerably by season. In many species, reproductive and metabolic processes are tightly linked to the seasonal change from winter to spring, yet we know little about how these processes will shift as winters become milder. This study examined latent effects of winter warming on spring reproduction in the Olympia oyster, Ostrea lurida. Adults were collected in autumn from central Puget Sound, WA, USA, and exposed to two winter temperatures (7 °C, 10 °C) in the presence of food limited (5 k algal cells/mL) and food abundant (50 k algal cells/mL) environments. Following treatments, adults exposed to elevated winter temperature contained larger oocytes regardless of feeding regime, and those also fed abundant food contained more developed sperm. Adults then spawned in common conditions, and larvae were reared through settlement to assess carryover effects of winter treatments on larval viability. Adults previously exposed to elevated winter temperature (10 °C) produced larger larvae, particularly if they were also fed high food levels. More developed gametes and larger larvae suggest that gametogenesis occurred at low levels throughout the winter, possibly resulting in increased maternal provisioning to influence larval size. Interestingly, winter temperature did not impact larval survival, or the timing or magnitude of larval production. In the wild, more developed gametes and larger larvae following milder winters could greatly impact recruitment patterns, possibly benefitting O. lurida populations. In the hatchery setting, larval production and survival is not contingent upon winter conditions, and larval survival does not correlate with oocyte and larval size. Our results suggest that O. lurida reproduction is resilient to winter warming. Furthermore, as global temperature continues to rise, winter conditions should not be overlooked when examining reproduction in O. lurida and other temperate marine invertebrates with similar reproductive cycles."

    "text": "Abstract\nBackground Sublethal exposure to environmental challenges may enhance ability to cope with chronic or repeated change, a process known as priming. In a previous study, pre-exposure to seawater enriched with pCO2 improved growth and reduced antioxidant capacity of juvenile Pacific geoduck Panopea generosa clams, suggesting that transcriptional shifts may drive phenotypic modifications post-priming. To this end, juvenile clams were sampled and TagSeq gene expression data were analysed after (i) a 110-day acclimation under ambient (921 μatm, naïve) and moderately elevated pCO2 (2870 μatm, pre-exposed); then following (ii) a second 7-day exposure to three pCO2 treatments (ambient: 754 μatm; moderately elevated: 2750 μatm; severely elevated: 4940 μatm), a 7-day return to ambient pCO2 and a third 7-day exposure to two pCO2 treatments (ambient: 967 μatm; moderately elevated: 3030 μatm). Pre-exposed geoducks frontloaded genes for stress and apoptosis/innate immune response, homeostatic processes, protein degradation and transcriptional modifiers. Pre-exposed geoducks were also responsive to subsequent encounters, with gene sets enriched for mitochondrial recycling and immune defence under elevated pCO2 and energy metabolism and biosynthesis under ambient recovery. In contrast, gene sets with higher expression in naïve clams were enriched for fatty-acid degradation and glutathione components, suggesting naïve clams could be depleting endogenous fuels, with unsustainable energetic requirements if changes in carbonate chemistry persist. Collectively, our transcriptomic data indicate that pCO2 priming during post-larval periods could, via gene expression regulation, enhance robustness in bivalves to environmental change. Such priming approaches may be beneficial for aquaculture, as seafood demand intensifies concurrent with increasing climate change in marine systems."

    "text": "Abstract\nPopulations of marine species that respond differently to ocean acidification offer natural reservoirs of biodiversity that can be leveraged for conservation efforts and to sustain marine food systems. The molecular and physiological traits associated with tolerance to acidification must first be identified. This study leveraged oysters from three phenotypically-distinct populations of the Olympia oyster, Ostrea lurida, but that were bred and reared in common conditions for four years. We assessed their growth, reproductive development, and transcriptional response to acidification within and across generations. Responses reveal energetic trade-offs that reflect unique physiotypes previously observed among populations. The population with the slowest growth but high survival rates, oysters from Dabob Bay, mounted the largest transcriptional response to acidification without effects to growth and reproduction. A moderate response was observed in the population with fastest growth rate but lowest fecundity (Fidalgo Bay). Oyster Bay, the population with highest fecundity but lowest survival rates, did not respond at the transcript level. Oyster Bay was also the only population for which acidification negatively affected growth and reproductive development. While exposure to acidification did not affect gene expression in the next generation’s larval stage, it did result in larger larvae in the Oyster Bay population, which could partially alleviate negative effects of acidification in the wild for that population. Given the distinct transcriptional response of the Dabob Bay population to acidification and its high survival rates in previous studies, we then identified genes that were uniquely expressed in Dabob Bay oysters compared to the other populations. Genes involved in antibacterial and antiviral processes, metabolism, growth, and reproduction were uniquely expressed in Dabob Bay, and many similar functions were identified in both adults and larvae, which provides insight into the mechanisms behind a stress-tolerant oyster population. The population-specific physiotypes and responses to acidification illustrate the diversity of physiological strategies in O. lurida that balance the energetic demands of growth, reproduction, cellular maintenance, and offspring viability. Taken together this study reveals that there are distinct physiotypes among marine invertebrate populations on small geographic scales with implications for species resilience to acidification and other environmental stressors."

    "text": "Abstract\nGiven the rapidly changing global climate, there is a growing need to understand the acclimatory basis of animal response to environmental change. To investigate the role of DNA methylation in environmental acclimatization, we generated a reference genome and surveyed the physiology and DNA methylomes of juvenile geoduck clams, Panopea generosa, under differing seawater pH regimes. Juveniles were initially exposed to one of three seawater pH conditions, followed by ambient common-garden conditions, then a second reciprocal exposure to ambient pH or pH 7.4. Within 10 days of the initial low pH exposure, juvenile clams showed decreased shell size relative to ambient pH with corresponding differential DNA methylation. Following four months of ambient common-garden conditions, juveniles initially exposed to low pH compensatorily grew larger, with DNA methylation indicative of these phenotypic differences, demonstrating epigenetic carryover effects persisted months after initial exposure. Functional enrichment analysis of differentially methylated genes revealed regulation of signal transduction through widespread changes in the Wnt signaling pathways that influence cell growth, proliferation, tissue and skeletal formation, and cytoskeletal change. After 10 days of secondary exposure to pH 7.4, naive juvenile clams were more sensitive to low pH compared to those initially exposed, showing reduced growth and having nearly a 2-fold greater change in DNA methylation. Collectively, this new genomic resource and coordinated phenotypic and methylomic response support that epigenetic mechanisms underlie acclimatization to provide beneficial phenotypes."

    "text": "Abstract\nFor marine invertebrates with a pelagic–benthic life cycle, larval exposure to ocean acidification (OA) can affect adult performance in response to another environmental stressor. This carry-over effect has the potential to alter phenotypic traits. However, the molecular mechanisms that mediate “OA”-triggered carry-over effects have not been explored despite such information being key to improving species fitness and management strategies for aquafarming. This study integrated the genome-wide DNA methylome and transcriptome to examine epigenetic modification-mediated carry-over OA impacts on phenotypic traits of the ecologically and commercially important oyster species Crassostrea hongkongensis under field conditions. Larvae of C. hongkongensis were exposed to control pH 8.0 and low pH 7.4 conditions, mimicking near future OA scenario in their habitat, before being outplanted as post-metamorphic juveniles at two mariculture field sites with contrasting environmental stressors for 9 months. The larval carry-over OA effect was found to have persistent impacts on the growth and survival trade-off traits on the outplanted juveniles, although the beneficial or adverse effect depended on the environmental conditions at the outplanted sites. Site-specific plasticity was demonstrated with a diverse DNA methylation-associated gene expression profile, with signal transduction and the endocrine system being the most common and highly enriched functions. Highly methylated exons prevailed in the key genes related to general metabolic and endocytic responses and these genes are evolutionarily conserved in various marine invertebrates in response to OA. These results suggest that oysters with prior larval exposure history to OA had the ability to trigger rapid local adaptive responses via epigenetic modification to cope with multiple stressors in the field."

    "text": "Abstract\nSymbiosis with protists is common among cnidarians such as corals and sea anemones and is associated with homeostatic and phenotypic changes in the host that could have epigenetic underpinnings, such as methylation of CpG dinucleotides. We leveraged the sensitivity to base modifications of nanopore sequencing to probe the effect of symbiosis with the chlorophyte Elliptochloris marina on methylation in the sea anemone Anthopleura elegantissima. We first validated the approach by comparison of nanopore-derived methylation levels with CpG depletion analysis of a published transcriptome, finding that high methylation levels are associated with CpG depletion as expected. Next, using reads generated exclusively from aposymbiotic anemones, a largely complete draft genome comprising 243 Mb was assembled. Reads from aposymbiotic and symbiotic sea anemones were then mapped to this genome and assessed for methylation using the program Nanopolish, which detects signal disruptions from base modifications as they pass through the nanopore. Based on assessment of 452,841 CpGs for which there was adequate read coverage (approximately 8% of the CpGs in the genome), symbiosis with E. marina was, surprisingly, associated with only subtle changes in the host methylome. However, we did identify one extended genomic region with consistently higher methylation among symbiotic individuals. The region was associated with a DNA polymerase zeta that is noted for its role in translesion synthesis, which opens interesting questions about the biology of this symbiosis. Our study highlights the power and relative simplicity of nanopore sequencing for studies of nucleic acid base modifications in non-model species."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nBackground There is a need to investigate mechanisms of phenotypic plasticity in marine invertebrates as negative effects of climate change, like ocean acidification, are experienced by coastal ecosystems. Environmentally-induced changes to the methylome may regulate gene expression, but methylome responses can be species- and tissue-specific. Tissue-specificity has implications for gonad tissue, as gonad-specific methylation patterns may be inherited by offspring. We used the Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) — a model for understanding pH impacts on bivalve molecular physiology due to its genomic resources and importance in global aquaculture— to assess how low pH could impact the gonad methylome. Oysters were exposed to either low pH (7.31 ± 0.02) or ambient pH (7.82 ± 0.02) conditions for 7 weeks. Whole genome bisulfite sequencing was used to identify methylated regions in female oyster gonad samples. C- &gt; T single nucleotide polymorphisms were identified and removed to ensure accurate methylation characterization. Results Analysis of gonad methylomes revealed a total of 1284 differentially methylated loci (DML) found primarily in genes, with several genes containing multiple DML. Gene ontologies for genes containing DML were involved in development and stress response, suggesting methylation may promote gonad growth homeostasis in low pH conditions. Additionally, several of these genes were associated with cytoskeletal structure regulation, metabolism, and protein ubiquitination — commonly-observed responses to ocean acidification. Comparison of these DML with other Crassostrea spp. exposed to ocean acidification demonstrates that similar pathways, but not identical genes, are impacted by methylation. Conclusions Our work suggests DNA methylation may have a regulatory role in gonad and larval development, which would shape adult and offspring responses to low pH stress. Combined with existing molluscan methylome research, our work further supports the need for tissue- and species-specific studies to understand the potential regulatory role of DNA methylation."

In this study, we integrated genomic and DNA methylation data for two distinct Olympia oyster (Ostrea lurida) populations while controlling for within-generation environmental influences. In addition to providing the first characterization of genome-wide DNA methylation patterns in the oyster genus Ostrea, we identified 3,963 differentially methylated loci between populations. Our results show a clear coupling between genetic and epigenetic patterns of variation, with 27% of variation in interindividual methylation differences explained by genotype. Underlying this association are both direct genetic changes in CpGs (CpG-SNPs) and genetic variation with indirect influence on methylation (mQTLs). When comparing measures of genetic and epigenetic population divergence at specific genomic regions this relationship surprisingly breaks down, which has implications for the methods commonly used to study epigenetic and genetic coupling in marine invertebrates.\n\n\n\nfig7"

Here, we characterized the degree by which genetic variation and DNA methylation variation are coupled in a marine invertebrate and identified potential mechanisms, with almost a third of the methylation variation attributable to genotype. This study provides a framework for future studies in environmental epigenetics to take genetic variation into account when teasing apart the drivers of phenotypic variation. By identifying methylation variation that cannot be attributed to genotype or environmental changes during development, our results also highlight the need for future research to characterize molecular mechanisms adjacent to genetic adaptation for producing long-term shifts in phenotype."

    "text": "Abstract\nHeat stress is one of the factors that affect aquaculture production of the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas in Mexico, and research aiming to improve heat tolerance is required. C. gigas breeding stock, produced for genetic improvement, is being implemented, and breeding lines available with 50 families were characterized for their heat-tolerance, selecting the two-most heat-resistant and the two-most heat-susceptible families. These families were analyzed for differences in their DNA methylation patterns after maintaining them for 30 days in a regime of oscillating temperatures (26 °C to 34 °C), similar to what is found in culture areas of Mexico. Whereas no differences were found in global methylation among heat-phenotypes, differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were found between phenotypes. Temperature modifies the methylation in gene bodies of C. gigas, where the heat-resistant phenotype (RR) showed more genes with DMRs in promoters (3672), exons (6340), and introns (18,685). Hyper-methylated genes among phenotypes were more abundant in RR introns (122), followed by exons (23), and promoters (2), whereas hypo-methylated regions corresponded to ten in introns, three in exons, and one in promoters. Hyper-methylated DMRs were mostly found in genes associated with processes such as regulation of gene expression, ions interactions, metabolism, and production of cellular components. This suggests that DMRs among heat-phenotypes in C. gigas families are involved in the heat-shock stress response regulated by methylation. The DMRs reported in this study could be used as methylation markers for a future broodstock selection."

    "text": "Abstract\nSince the introduction of the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas in Baja California Sur, Mexico, its culture has faced environmental challenges, specifically increasing temperatures that result in high mortalities. The inter-tidal zone seawater temperature during a year at the Baja California Peninsula broadly ranges from 7 °C to 39 °C. Therefore, to understand how oysters respond to heat stress during daily temperature oscillations, heat-resistant (RR, father, and mother resistant) and heat-susceptible (SS, both parents susceptible) phenotypes families from a C. gigas breeding program were exposed to a thermal challenge. Based on a laboratory-simulated daily oscillatory thermal challenge (26 to 34 °C) for 30 days, RR phenotype presented differences compared to SS phenotype since the beginning (day 0) of the thermal challenge. Gene expression analyses revealed 1822 differentially expressed up-regulated transcripts in RR, related to functions of metabolic processes, biological regulation, and response to stimulus and signaling. At the end of the experiment (day 30), 2660 differentially expressed up-regulated transcripts were identified in RR. Functional analysis of the genes expressed indicates responses of regulation of biological processes and response to a stimulus. Additionally, 340 genes were differentially expressed among RR vs. SS from the beginning to the end of the thermal challenge, where 170 genes were up-regulated, and 170 were down-regulated. These transcriptomic profiles represent the first report to identify gene expression markers associated with RR phenotypes for the Pacific oyster to the future broodstock selection.\n\n\n\nga"

    "text": "Abstract\nBiomineralization is one of the key processes that is notably affected in marine calcifiers such as oysters under ocean acidification (OA). Understanding molecular changes in the biomineralization process under OA and its heritability, therefore, is key to developing conservation strategies for protecting ecologically and economically important oyster species. To do this, in this study, we have explicitly chosen the tissue involved in biomineralization (mantle) of an estuarine commercial oyster species, Crassostrea hongkongensis. The primary aim of this study is to understand the influence of DNA methylation over gene expression of mantle tissue under decreased ~pH 7.4, a proxy of OA, and to extrapolate if these molecular changes can be observed in the product of biomineralization—the shell. We grew early juvenile C. hongkongensis, under decreased ~pH 7.4 and control ~pH 8.0 over 4.5 months and studied OA-induced DNA methylation and gene expression patterns along with shell properties such as microstructure, crystal orientation and hardness. The population of oysters used in this study was found to be moderately resilient to OA at the end of the experiment. The expression of key biomineralization-related genes such as carbonic anhydrase and alkaline phosphatase remained unaffected; thus, the mechanical properties of the shell (shell growth rate, hardness and crystal orientation) were also maintained without any significant difference between control and OA conditions with signs of severe dissolution. In addition, this study makes three major conclusions: (1) higher expression of Ca2+ binding/signalling-related genes in the mantle plays a key role in maintaining biomineralization under OA; (2) DNA methylation changes occur in response to OA; however, these methylation changes do not directly control gene expression; and (3) OA would be more of a 'dissolution problem' rather than a 'biomineralization problem' for resilient species that maintain calcification rate with normal shell growth and mechanical properties."

    "text": "Abstract\nTanner crab (Chionoecetes bairdi) is an economically important species that is threatened by ocean warming and bitter crab disease, which is caused by an endoparasitic dinoflagellate, Hematodinium. Little is known about disease transmission or its link to host mortality, or how ocean warming will affect pathogenicity or host susceptibility. To provide a transcriptomic resource for the Tanner crab, we generated a suite of RNA-seq libraries encompassing pooled hemolymph samples from crab displaying differing infection statuses and maintained at different temperatures (ambient (7.5˚C), elevated (10˚C), or decreased (4˚C)). After assembling a transcriptome and performing a multifactor differential gene expression analysis, we found genes influenced by temperature in relation to infection and detected some of those genes over time at the individual level using RNA-seq data from one crab. Biological processes associated with those genes include lipid storage, transcription, response to oxidative stress, cell adhesion, and morphogenesis. Alteration in lipid storage and transcription provide insight into how temperature impacts energy allocation in Hematodinium infected crabs. Alteration in expression patterns in genes associated with morphogenesis could suggest that hemocytes were changing morphology and/or type in response to temperature. This project provides insight into how Hematodinium infection could influence crab physiology as oceans warm."

    "text": "Abstract\nPacific oysters (Crassostrea gigas) are a valuable aquaculture product that provides important ecosystem benefits. Among other threats, climate-driven changes in ocean temperature can impact oyster metabolism, survivorship, and immune function. We investigated how elevated temperature impacts larval oysters during settlement (19–33 days post-fertilization), using shotgun proteomics with data-independent acquisition to identify proteins present in the oysters after 2 weeks of exposure to 23 °C or 29 °C. Oysters maintained at elevated temperatures were larger and had a higher settlement rate, with 86% surviving to the end of the experiment; these oysters also had higher abundance trends of proteins related to metabolism and growth. Oysters held at 23 °C were smaller, had a decreased settlement rate, displayed 100% mortality, and had elevated abundance trends of proteins related to immune response. This novel use of proteomics was able to capture characteristic shifts in protein abundance that hint at important differences in the phenotypic response of Pacific oysters to temperature regimes. Additionally, this work has produced a robust proteomic product that will be the basis for future research on bivalve developmental processes."

I then joined the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, where I worked on Bering Sea crab surveys, Tanner crab fecundity and movement studies, and fishery monitoring projects. After moving down to Seattle, I joined the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife, where I researched forage fish spawning and development. At the Roberts lab, I joined my interests in disease and crabs by studying gene expression in southeast Alaskan Tanner crabs and in Hematodinium, the parasitic dinoflagellate that causes Bitter Crab Syndrome.

During that time, I completed my undergraduate capstone project analyzing the effects of bifenthrin exposure on the behavior of the federally endangered Delta Smelt. After graduating with a bachelor of science in Animal Biology in 2020, I continued my research work in that same lab for an additional two years and further explored the developmental, behavioral, and reproductive impacts several commonly employed urban and agricultural pyrethroids had on native Californian estuarine fish species. In 2022, I dually joined the Gardell Lab at the University of Washington, Tacoma and the Roberts Lab housed in the School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences (SAFS) at the University of Washington, Seattle.

However, despite my high school focus on studying mathematics, a lifelong interest in how climate change was affecting the world prompted me to join a coral phylogenetics lab in my first year of undergrad. My experience there sparked an ongoing interest in studying the impacts of climate change on vulnerable ecological systems. Throughout my undergraduate career at Harvey Mudd College I continued to study soft coral taxonomy and population genetics using both molecular and NGS methods, culminating in a thesis project for which I utilized target capture of conserved elements to improve species delimitation and understanding of biogeographical diversity in the speciose octocoral genus Sclerophytum (formerly Sinularia). I graduated with a B.S. in Mathematical and Computational Biology and an Emphasis in Environmental Analysis in May 2023 and spent the following summer working as a Lab Technician for my undergraduate lab, both continuing my research and managing the lab’s daily operation. Moving into graduate work I’m excited to shift my research focus to studying physiological stress response in marine invertebrates, and I’m looking forward to figuring out what project(s) I’ll get to be a part of in the Roberts Lab!

Specifically, we will determine the physiological impact of OA conditions on adult clams and determine how this impacts reproduction by assessing reproductive success as well as gene expression in gametes. Larvae collected from clams will also be used to determine transgenerational effects on the capacity of larvae to tolerate the same OA conditions by assessing growth performance and gene expression. Results from these experiments are intentionally aimed at expanding the portfolio of options for Puget Sound shellfish growers, and I will be involved in surveying growers to determine the applicability of the methods we develop on clam production. I am also active in a separate project to identify and then silence genes expressed in the development of germ line cells in shellfish embryos, with the ultimate goal of establishing a method for producing sterile shellfish for use in aquaculture.\nI have a background in comparative physiology having completed a dissertation comparing the molecular response of two species of tilapia to increased environmental salinity levels. This research including transcriptomic and proteomic analysis of the main tissues responsible for ion balance (gill and kidney). This work was also aimed at aiding aquaculture producers by allowing them to use partial seawater in tilapia ponds and reduce the use of freshwater, especially in areas which have scarce freshwater resources.\nWhen not doing research, I am an avid hiker, and I enjoy a number of hobbies including woodworking, playing musical instruments, baking, and playing with my dogs Nimbus and Pepita."
