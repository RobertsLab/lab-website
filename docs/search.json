    "text": "Abstract\nPacific oysters (Crassostrea gigas) are a valuable aquaculture product that provides important ecosystem benefits. Among other threats, climate-driven changes in ocean temperature can impact oyster metabolism, survivorship, and immune function. We investigated how elevated temperature impacts larval oysters during settlement (19–33 days post-fertilization), using shotgun proteomics with data-independent acquisition to identify proteins present in the oysters after 2 weeks of exposure to 23 °C or 29 °C. Oysters maintained at elevated temperatures were larger and had a higher settlement rate, with 86% surviving to the end of the experiment; these oysters also had higher abundance trends of proteins related to metabolism and growth. Oysters held at 23 °C were smaller, had a decreased settlement rate, displayed 100% mortality, and had elevated abundance trends of proteins related to immune response. This novel use of proteomics was able to capture characteristic shifts in protein abundance that hint at important differences in the phenotypic response of Pacific oysters to temperature regimes. Additionally, this work has produced a robust proteomic product that will be the basis for future research on bivalve developmental processes."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nBiomineralization is one of the key processes that is notably affected in marine calcifiers such as oysters under ocean acidification (OA). Understanding molecular changes in the biomineralization process under OA and its heritability, therefore, is key to developing conservation strategies for protecting ecologically and economically important oyster species. To do this, in this study, we have explicitly chosen the tissue involved in biomineralization (mantle) of an estuarine commercial oyster species, Crassostrea hongkongensis. The primary aim of this study is to understand the influence of DNA methylation over gene expression of mantle tissue under decreased ~pH 7.4, a proxy of OA, and to extrapolate if these molecular changes can be observed in the product of biomineralization—the shell. We grew early juvenile C. hongkongensis, under decreased ~pH 7.4 and control ~pH 8.0 over 4.5 months and studied OA-induced DNA methylation and gene expression patterns along with shell properties such as microstructure, crystal orientation and hardness. The population of oysters used in this study was found to be moderately resilient to OA at the end of the experiment. The expression of key biomineralization-related genes such as carbonic anhydrase and alkaline phosphatase remained unaffected; thus, the mechanical properties of the shell (shell growth rate, hardness and crystal orientation) were also maintained without any significant difference between control and OA conditions with signs of severe dissolution. In addition, this study makes three major conclusions: (1) higher expression of Ca2+ binding/signalling-related genes in the mantle plays a key role in maintaining biomineralization under OA; (2) DNA methylation changes occur in response to OA; however, these methylation changes do not directly control gene expression; and (3) OA would be more of a 'dissolution problem' rather than a 'biomineralization problem' for resilient species that maintain calcification rate with normal shell growth and mechanical properties."

    "text": "Abstract\nHeat stress is one of the factors that affect aquaculture production of the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas in Mexico, and research aiming to improve heat tolerance is required. C. gigas breeding stock, produced for genetic improvement, is being implemented, and breeding lines available with 50 families were characterized for their heat-tolerance, selecting the two-most heat-resistant and the two-most heat-susceptible families. These families were analyzed for differences in their DNA methylation patterns after maintaining them for 30 days in a regime of oscillating temperatures (26 °C to 34 °C), similar to what is found in culture areas of Mexico. Whereas no differences were found in global methylation among heat-phenotypes, differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were found between phenotypes. Temperature modifies the methylation in gene bodies of C. gigas, where the heat-resistant phenotype (RR) showed more genes with DMRs in promoters (3672), exons (6340), and introns (18,685). Hyper-methylated genes among phenotypes were more abundant in RR introns (122), followed by exons (23), and promoters (2), whereas hypo-methylated regions corresponded to ten in introns, three in exons, and one in promoters. Hyper-methylated DMRs were mostly found in genes associated with processes such as regulation of gene expression, ions interactions, metabolism, and production of cellular components. This suggests that DMRs among heat-phenotypes in C. gigas families are involved in the heat-shock stress response regulated by methylation. The DMRs reported in this study could be used as methylation markers for a future broodstock selection."

In this study, we integrated genomic and DNA methylation data for two distinct Olympia oyster (Ostrea lurida) populations while controlling for within-generation environmental influences. In addition to providing the first characterization of genome-wide DNA methylation patterns in the oyster genus Ostrea, we identified 3,963 differentially methylated loci between populations. Our results show a clear coupling between genetic and epigenetic patterns of variation, with 27% of variation in interindividual methylation differences explained by genotype. Underlying this association are both direct genetic changes in CpGs (CpG-SNPs) and genetic variation with indirect influence on methylation (mQTLs). When comparing measures of genetic and epigenetic population divergence at specific genomic regions this relationship surprisingly breaks down, which has implications for the methods commonly used to study epigenetic and genetic coupling in marine invertebrates.\n\n\n\nfig7"

Here, we characterized the degree by which genetic variation and DNA methylation variation are coupled in a marine invertebrate and identified potential mechanisms, with almost a third of the methylation variation attributable to genotype. This study provides a framework for future studies in environmental epigenetics to take genetic variation into account when teasing apart the drivers of phenotypic variation. By identifying methylation variation that cannot be attributed to genotype or environmental changes during development, our results also highlight the need for future research to characterize molecular mechanisms adjacent to genetic adaptation for producing long-term shifts in phenotype."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nBackground There is a need to investigate mechanisms of phenotypic plasticity in marine invertebrates as negative effects of climate change, like ocean acidification, are experienced by coastal ecosystems. Environmentally-induced changes to the methylome may regulate gene expression, but methylome responses can be species- and tissue-specific. Tissue-specificity has implications for gonad tissue, as gonad-specific methylation patterns may be inherited by offspring. We used the Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) — a model for understanding pH impacts on bivalve molecular physiology due to its genomic resources and importance in global aquaculture— to assess how low pH could impact the gonad methylome. Oysters were exposed to either low pH (7.31 ± 0.02) or ambient pH (7.82 ± 0.02) conditions for 7 weeks. Whole genome bisulfite sequencing was used to identify methylated regions in female oyster gonad samples. C- &gt; T single nucleotide polymorphisms were identified and removed to ensure accurate methylation characterization. Results Analysis of gonad methylomes revealed a total of 1284 differentially methylated loci (DML) found primarily in genes, with several genes containing multiple DML. Gene ontologies for genes containing DML were involved in development and stress response, suggesting methylation may promote gonad growth homeostasis in low pH conditions. Additionally, several of these genes were associated with cytoskeletal structure regulation, metabolism, and protein ubiquitination — commonly-observed responses to ocean acidification. Comparison of these DML with other Crassostrea spp. exposed to ocean acidification demonstrates that similar pathways, but not identical genes, are impacted by methylation. Conclusions Our work suggests DNA methylation may have a regulatory role in gonad and larval development, which would shape adult and offspring responses to low pH stress. Combined with existing molluscan methylome research, our work further supports the need for tissue- and species-specific studies to understand the potential regulatory role of DNA methylation."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nSymbiosis with protists is common among cnidarians such as corals and sea anemones and is associated with homeostatic and phenotypic changes in the host that could have epigenetic underpinnings, such as methylation of CpG dinucleotides. We leveraged the sensitivity to base modifications of nanopore sequencing to probe the effect of symbiosis with the chlorophyte Elliptochloris marina on methylation in the sea anemone Anthopleura elegantissima. We first validated the approach by comparison of nanopore-derived methylation levels with CpG depletion analysis of a published transcriptome, finding that high methylation levels are associated with CpG depletion as expected. Next, using reads generated exclusively from aposymbiotic anemones, a largely complete draft genome comprising 243 Mb was assembled. Reads from aposymbiotic and symbiotic sea anemones were then mapped to this genome and assessed for methylation using the program Nanopolish, which detects signal disruptions from base modifications as they pass through the nanopore. Based on assessment of 452,841 CpGs for which there was adequate read coverage (approximately 8% of the CpGs in the genome), symbiosis with E. marina was, surprisingly, associated with only subtle changes in the host methylome. However, we did identify one extended genomic region with consistently higher methylation among symbiotic individuals. The region was associated with a DNA polymerase zeta that is noted for its role in translesion synthesis, which opens interesting questions about the biology of this symbiosis. Our study highlights the power and relative simplicity of nanopore sequencing for studies of nucleic acid base modifications in non-model species."

    "text": "Synopsis\nUnderstanding the mechanisms that underlie resilience in marine invertebrates is critical as climate change and human impacts transform coastal ecosystems. Metabolic plasticity, or an organism’s capacity to modulate energy production, allocation, and use, plays a central role in mediating resilience under environmental stress. While research on marine invertebrate stress responses has grown, integrative studies that examine metabolic plasticity by connecting molecular, physiological, and organismal scales remain limited. In this Perspective, we advocate for the rigorous and thoughtful use of metabolomic and lipidomic approaches to understand resilience in marine systems through the lens of metabolic plasticity. We provide recommendations for experimental design, summarize current methodologies, and provide an overview of commonly used data analysis approaches. Advances in other molecular approaches such as genomics, epigenomics, and transcriptomics can be harnessed to further explore stress responses through multi-omic integrative analyses. As quantitative integrative analysis remains limited in marine fields, we call for a stronger integration of molecular, metabolomic, physiological, and organismal data sets to link mechanisms to phenotypes. We explore the use of these approaches in studies of marine invertebrates and highlight promising areas of multi-omic research that deserve exploration. By embracing metabolic complexity and scaling from molecules to phenotypes, we suggest that the marine invertebrate research community will be better equipped to understand, anticipate, and mitigate the impacts of environmental change on marine ecosystems."

    "text": "Abstract\nRising sea surface temperatures are increasingly causing breakdown in the nutritional relationship between corals and algal endosymbionts (Symbiodiniaceae), threatening the basis of coral reef ecosystems and highlighting the critical role of coral reproduction in reef maintenance. The effects of thermal stress on metabolic exchange (i.e., transfer of fixed carbon photosynthates from symbiont to host) during sensitive early life stages, however, remains understudied. We exposed symbiotic Montipora capitata coral larvae in Hawaiʻi to high temperature (+2.5°C for 3 days), assessed rates of photosynthesis and respiration, and used stable isotope tracing (4 mM 13C sodium bicarbonate; 4.5 h) to quantify metabolite exchange. While larvae did not show any signs of bleaching and did not experience declines in survival and settlement, metabolic depression was significant under high temperature, indicated by a 19% reduction in respiration rates, but with no change in photosynthesis. Larvae exposed to high temperature showed evidence for maintained translocation of a major photosynthate, glucose, from the symbiont, but there was reduced metabolism of glucose through central carbon metabolism (i.e., glycolysis). The larval host invested in nitrogen cycling by increasing ammonium assimilation, urea metabolism, and sequestration of nitrogen into dipeptides, a mechanism that may support the maintenance of glucose translocation under thermal stress. Host nitrogen assimilation via dipeptide synthesis appears to be used for nitrogen limitation to the Symbiodiniaceae, and we hypothesize that nitrogen limitation contributes to retention of fixed carbon by favoring photosynthate translocation to the host. Collectively, our findings indicate that although these larvae are susceptible to metabolic stress under high temperature, diverting energy to nitrogen assimilation to maintain symbiont population density, photosynthesis, and carbon translocation may allow larvae to avoid bleaching and highlights potential life stage specific metabolic responses to stress."

    "text": "Abstract\nGiven the rapidly changing global climate, there is a growing need to understand the acclimatory basis of animal response to environmental change. To investigate the role of DNA methylation in environmental acclimatization, we generated a reference genome and surveyed the physiology and DNA methylomes of juvenile geoduck clams, Panopea generosa, under differing seawater pH regimes. Juveniles were initially exposed to one of three seawater pH conditions, followed by ambient common-garden conditions, then a second reciprocal exposure to ambient pH or pH 7.4. Within 10 days of the initial low pH exposure, juvenile clams showed decreased shell size relative to ambient pH with corresponding differential DNA methylation. Following four months of ambient common-garden conditions, juveniles initially exposed to low pH compensatorily grew larger, with DNA methylation indicative of these phenotypic differences, demonstrating epigenetic carryover effects persisted months after initial exposure. Functional enrichment analysis of differentially methylated genes revealed regulation of signal transduction through widespread changes in the Wnt signaling pathways that influence cell growth, proliferation, tissue and skeletal formation, and cytoskeletal change. After 10 days of secondary exposure to pH 7.4, naive juvenile clams were more sensitive to low pH compared to those initially exposed, showing reduced growth and having nearly a 2-fold greater change in DNA methylation. Collectively, this new genomic resource and coordinated phenotypic and methylomic response support that epigenetic mechanisms underlie acclimatization to provide beneficial phenotypes."

    "text": "Abstract\nPopulations of marine species that respond differently to ocean acidification offer natural reservoirs of biodiversity that can be leveraged for conservation efforts and to sustain marine food systems. The molecular and physiological traits associated with tolerance to acidification must first be identified. This study leveraged oysters from three phenotypically-distinct populations of the Olympia oyster, Ostrea lurida, but that were bred and reared in common conditions for four years. We assessed their growth, reproductive development, and transcriptional response to acidification within and across generations. Responses reveal energetic trade-offs that reflect unique physiotypes previously observed among populations. The population with the slowest growth but high survival rates, oysters from Dabob Bay, mounted the largest transcriptional response to acidification without effects to growth and reproduction. A moderate response was observed in the population with fastest growth rate but lowest fecundity (Fidalgo Bay). Oyster Bay, the population with highest fecundity but lowest survival rates, did not respond at the transcript level. Oyster Bay was also the only population for which acidification negatively affected growth and reproductive development. While exposure to acidification did not affect gene expression in the next generation’s larval stage, it did result in larger larvae in the Oyster Bay population, which could partially alleviate negative effects of acidification in the wild for that population. Given the distinct transcriptional response of the Dabob Bay population to acidification and its high survival rates in previous studies, we then identified genes that were uniquely expressed in Dabob Bay oysters compared to the other populations. Genes involved in antibacterial and antiviral processes, metabolism, growth, and reproduction were uniquely expressed in Dabob Bay, and many similar functions were identified in both adults and larvae, which provides insight into the mechanisms behind a stress-tolerant oyster population. The population-specific physiotypes and responses to acidification illustrate the diversity of physiological strategies in O. lurida that balance the energetic demands of growth, reproduction, cellular maintenance, and offspring viability. Taken together this study reveals that there are distinct physiotypes among marine invertebrate populations on small geographic scales with implications for species resilience to acidification and other environmental stressors."

    "text": "Abstract\nBackground Sublethal exposure to environmental challenges may enhance ability to cope with chronic or repeated change, a process known as priming. In a previous study, pre-exposure to seawater enriched with pCO2 improved growth and reduced antioxidant capacity of juvenile Pacific geoduck Panopea generosa clams, suggesting that transcriptional shifts may drive phenotypic modifications post-priming. To this end, juvenile clams were sampled and TagSeq gene expression data were analysed after (i) a 110-day acclimation under ambient (921 μatm, naïve) and moderately elevated pCO2 (2870 μatm, pre-exposed); then following (ii) a second 7-day exposure to three pCO2 treatments (ambient: 754 μatm; moderately elevated: 2750 μatm; severely elevated: 4940 μatm), a 7-day return to ambient pCO2 and a third 7-day exposure to two pCO2 treatments (ambient: 967 μatm; moderately elevated: 3030 μatm). Pre-exposed geoducks frontloaded genes for stress and apoptosis/innate immune response, homeostatic processes, protein degradation and transcriptional modifiers. Pre-exposed geoducks were also responsive to subsequent encounters, with gene sets enriched for mitochondrial recycling and immune defence under elevated pCO2 and energy metabolism and biosynthesis under ambient recovery. In contrast, gene sets with higher expression in naïve clams were enriched for fatty-acid degradation and glutathione components, suggesting naïve clams could be depleting endogenous fuels, with unsustainable energetic requirements if changes in carbonate chemistry persist. Collectively, our transcriptomic data indicate that pCO2 priming during post-larval periods could, via gene expression regulation, enhance robustness in bivalves to environmental change. Such priming approaches may be beneficial for aquaculture, as seafood demand intensifies concurrent with increasing climate change in marine systems."

To test the role of life-stage and stress-intensity dependence in eliciting enhanced tolerance under subsequent stress encounters, we initially conditioned pediveliger Pacific geoduck (Panopea generosa) larvae to ambient and moderately elevated PCO2 (920 µatm and 2800 µatm, respectively) for 110 days. Then, clams were exposed to ambient, moderate or severely elevated PCO2 (750, 2800 or 4900 µatm, respectively) for 7 days and, following 7 days in ambient conditions, a 7-day third exposure to ambient (970 µatm) or moderate PCO2 (3000 µatm). Initial conditioning to moderate PCO2 stress followed by second and third exposure to severe and moderate PCO2 stress increased respiration rate, organic biomass and shell size, suggesting a stress-intensity-dependent effect on energetics. Additionally, stress-acclimated clams had lower antioxidant capacity compared with clams under ambient conditions, supporting the hypothesis that stress over postlarval-to-juvenile development affects oxidative status later in life. Time series and stress intensity-specific approaches can reveal life-stages and magnitudes of exposure, respectively, that may elicit beneficial phenotypic variation."

Coding RNAs and non-coding RNAs, and specifically long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) were identified through whole transcriptome sequencing from different life stages. A total of 23,686 protein-coding genes and 12,558 non-coding RNAs were annotated. In addition, 6,308 lncRNAs and 5,774 miRNAs were found to be transcriptionally active from larvae to adult stages. Taken together, this genomic resource for C. rogercresseyi represents a valuable tool to develop sustainable control strategies in the salmon aquaculture industry."

    "text": "Abstract\nProjecting ecological and evolutionary responses to variable and changing environments is central to anticipating and managing impacts to biodiversity and ecosystems. Current modeling approaches are largely phenomenological and often fail to accurately project responses due to numerous biological processes at multiple levels of biological organization responding to environmental variation at varied spatial and temporal scales. Limited mechanistic understanding of organismal responses to environmental variability and extremes also restricts predictive capacity. We outline a strategy for identifying and modeling the key organismal mechanisms across levels of biological organization that mediate ecological and evolutionary responses to environmental variation. A central component of this strategy is quantifying timescales and magnitudes of climatic variability and how organisms experience them. We highlight recent empirical research that builds this information and suggest how to design future experiments that can produce more generalizable principles. We discuss how to create biologically informed projections in a feasible way by combining statistical and mechanistic approaches. Predictions will inform both fundamental and practical questions at the interface of ecology, evolution, and Earth science such as how organisms experience, adapt to, and respond to environmental variation at multiple hierarchical spatial and temporal scales."

    "text": "Abstract\nThe blue mussel Mytilus chilensis is an endemic and key socioeconomic species inhabiting the southern coast of Chile. This bivalve species supports a booming aquaculture industry, which entirely relies on artificially collected seeds from natural beds that are translocated to diverse physical–chemical ocean farming conditions. Furthermore, mussel production is threatened by a broad range of microorganisms, pollution, and environmental stressors that eventually impact its survival and growth. Herein, understanding the genomic basis of the local adaption is pivotal to developing sustainable shellfish aquaculture. We present a high-quality reference genome of M. chilensis, which is the first chromosome-level genome for a Mytilidae member in South America. The assembled genome size was 1.93 Gb, with a contig N50 of 134 Mb. Through Hi-C proximity ligation, 11,868 contigs were clustered, ordered, and assembled into 14 chromosomes in congruence with the karyological evidence. The M. chilensis genome comprises 34,530 genes and 4795 non-coding RNAs. A total of 57% of the genome contains repetitive sequences with predominancy of LTR-retrotransposons and unknown elements. Comparative genome analysis of M. chilensis and M. coruscus was conducted, revealing genic rearrangements distributed into the whole genome. Notably, transposable Steamer-like elements associated with horizontal transmissible cancer were explored in reference genomes, suggesting putative relationships at the chromosome level in Bivalvia. Genome expression analysis was also conducted, showing putative genomic differences between two ecologically different mussel populations. The evidence suggests that local genome adaptation and physiological plasticity can be analyzed to develop sustainable mussel production. The genome of M. chilensis provides pivotal molecular knowledge for the Mytilus complex."

    "text": "On May 6, 2024, Dr. Ariana Huffmyer, an NSF Ocean Sciences Postdoctoral Fellow from the University of Rhode Island and University of Washington, shared insights from a field day at Point Whitney. This comprehensive post revealed the detailed process of managing and monitoring oyster growth and stress testing, providing a clear framework for hatchery management.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLink to Full Notebook Post\n\n\n\nhttps://ahuffmyer.github.io/ASH_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/Hatchery-field-day-at-Point-Whitney-May-6-2024/\n\n\nOverview of Field Day Activities The objective was to monitor the health and stress responses of oyster cohorts at the hatchery. Key activities included calibrating monitoring equipment, feeding the oysters, and assessing the impacts of temperature and freshwater stress.\n\nMonitoring Equipment Calibration: Dr. Huffmyer set up and calibrated an Orion Star A325 probe to measure pH, temperature, and conductivity. By using buffers of varying pH and a conductivity solution, she ensured accurate measurements. The pH was measured on the NBS scale, considered sufficient since ocean acidification experiments weren’t being conducted.\nFeeding Protocol: The oysters were pulse-fed, where approximately 1/3 of a 5-gallon bucket was distributed among the tanks. This ensured that the animals received sufficient nutrition.\nFluorometry and Physiochemical Measurements: Fluorometry measurements were conducted before and after feeding, providing data on oyster metabolic activity. Additionally, pH, temperature, and conductivity were measured across different tanks, offering valuable weekly insights into water quality.\nStress Testing Regimen: Dr. Huffmyer conducted a 30-minute stress test for specific oyster cohorts using freshwater and elevated temperature exposures. Animals were subjected to 25°C temperature and freshwater immersion, replicating environmental stressors they might face. Trays were labeled and organized by stressor type.\nGrowth Characterization: Size measurements were taken using a waterproof digital caliper. Cohorts were categorized based on their respective stressors, creating a comprehensive understanding of their growth patterns.\nPloidy Testing Preparations: A selection of oysters from different cohorts was collected for ploidy testing to distinguish between diploid and triploid oysters. They were stored in mesh bags, and the testing results would provide critical information for future breeding programs.\n\n\n\n\nheath-tray\n\n\nTakeaways for Hatchery Science Dr. Huffmyer’s systematic approach highlights the significance of precise monitoring and stress testing in hatchery science. Understanding oyster resilience to environmental stressors is crucial for aquaculture sustainability. Her work at Point Whitney offers a detailed protocol that could be replicated or adapted by other researchers to monitor and improve hatchery operations.\nThe future of hatchery management will depend heavily on such frameworks, where real-time data collection and analysis enable researchers to respond promptly to environmental changes."

    "section": "",
    "text": "We are excited to share that our proposal, Development of SORMI (Summer Oyster Resilience and Mortality Index): A Quantitative Tool for Improving Field Survival, has been funded through the Western Regional Aquaculture Center. This multi-institutional effort will address one of the most pressing challenges in shellfish aquaculture—recurrent summer mortality in Pacific oysters.\n\nThe Challenge\nFor decades, oyster growers across the West Coast have faced sudden, large-scale summer die-offs linked to rising seawater temperatures, disease, and other stressors. These events threaten farm productivity and the economic stability of the shellfish industry. Despite years of research, a single cause has never been identified. Instead, we are taking a new approach: focusing on why oysters survive rather than why they die.\n\n\nWhat Is SORMI?\nSORMI—the Summer Oyster Resilience and Mortality Index—will be a generalized stress resilience index for Pacific oysters. By integrating a suite of physiological and metabolic assays, the index will help predict which oyster families are most resilient under real-world conditions. This tool will directly support breeding programs and hatcheries, providing a practical way to select for survival and reduce the frequency of catastrophic summer mortality events .\n\n\n\nOur Role at UW\nAt the Roberts Lab, our team will be leading development of innovative, high-throughput stress assays, including a new resazurin-based metabolic assay we have been refining as a cost-effective, scalable way to measure oyster metabolism. We will also work closely with partners to analyze stress resilience across hundreds of oyster families and link these traits to field survival outcomes. Our focus is on providing growers and breeding programs with actionable, science-based tools that are accessible and easy to implement.\n\n\nProject Leadership and Partners\nThis project is led by Bobbi Hudson, Executive Director of the Pacific Shellfish Institute (PSI). The collaborative team brings together expertise and resources from across the region, including:\n\nUniversity of Washington (Roberts Lab) – stress physiology and assay development\nUSDA Agricultural Research Service (Neil Thompson, Pacific Oyster Genomic Selection project) – breeding program integration and genetic analysis\nNOAA Fisheries (Mackenzie Gavery) – environmental physiology and genomics\nCalifornia Sea Grant (Kevin Johnson, Cal Poly) – aquaculture extension and grower engagement\nIndustry partners – Goose Point Oyster Company (WA) and Hog Island Oyster Company (CA)\n\nThis broad coalition ensures the project is grounded in industry needs while pushing forward fundamental science .\n\n\n\nImplications for the Shellfish Industry\nThe ultimate goal of SORMI is to give oyster growers a practical decision-making tool. With a reliable index, farmers could anticipate when their stocks are stressed and take proactive measures—harvesting before a mortality event, adjusting management practices, or prioritizing resilient broodstock. For breeding programs, SORMI will add a measurable, heritable trait that can accelerate development of hardier oyster lines.\nIn short, this project will help secure the future of West Coast oyster farming by turning science into survival."

His article, \"Navigating ocean acidification in shellfish aquaculture: Stakeholder perspectives of developing strategies in the U.S. Pacific Region\", was just released in Aquaculture Reports and offers an in-depth look at how shellfish growers across the U.S. Pacific Coast are responding to ocean acidification and related environmental stressors.\nThe study draws on structured interviews with producers from Washington, Oregon, California, Alaska, and Hawaii to capture evolving perceptions of ocean acidification and industry interest in emerging adaptation strategies. Notably, concern about ocean acidification appears to have declined in the past decade, as growers increasingly focus on intersecting threats such as harmful algal blooms, disease, and rising temperatures.\nThe paper explores two adaptation strategies under development: parental priming—a technique involving exposure of broodstock to stressful conditions to enhance offspring resilience—and native species portfolio expansion. While industry support for both strategies was mixed and often contingent on further scientific validation, the study emphasizes the importance of early engagement between researchers and growers to co-develop viable solutions.\nImportantly, this research aligns directly with ongoing environmental priming work in our lab, where we are experimentally testing how exposure to low pH and high temperature conditions in adult shellfish can influence offspring performance. By integrating physiological, transcriptomic, and lipidomic data, our current NOAA-funded work seeks to identify the mechanisms underlying carryover effects and inform hatchery practices that enhance larval resilience under future ocean conditions.\nConnor's collaboration with our group helped build the interdisciplinary foundation for this kind of applied science—where social, biological, and ecological factors intersect to shape adaptation in real-world settings. We're excited to see how his work complements and extends our efforts to support a more resilient shellfish aquaculture sector.\nRead the full article here."

    "section": "",
    "text": "As global demand for seafood continues to rise, the aquaculture industry faces growing pressure to produce more while minimizing ecological impacts. A key concern in marine fish farming is the risk of escapees interbreeding with wild populations, leading to genetic introgression and reduced fitness in native fish stocks. Now, a recent study led by former University of Washington CICOES postdoctoral researcher Dr. Yuzo R. Yanagitsuru offers a promising solution.\nPublished in Aquaculture, the study presents a proof-of-concept for a non-GMO, bath immersion–based technique for inducing sterility in sablefish (Anoplopoma fimbria)—an emerging high-value aquaculture species also known as black cod. The approach targets a gene essential for reproductive cell development and aims to prevent escaped farmed fish from reproducing in the wild.\n\nA Scalable, Gene-Silencing Alternative to Triploidy\nWhile triploidization and genetic modification have been explored for sterility induction, both come with drawbacks—triploid fish can still be partially fertile, and GM fish face regulatory and public acceptance hurdles.\nInstead, Dr. Yanagitsuru and collaborators used a Morpholino oligomer (MO) attached to a Vivo transporter to silence the dead end (dnd) gene—a critical regulator of primordial germ cell formation. The innovation lies in delivering this compound through a simple bath immersion, rather than invasive microinjection or genetic alteration.\n\n\nResults: A Step Toward Sterile, Sustainable Farming\nIn controlled hatchery trials, sablefish eggs treated with the dnd-MO-Vivo compound before fertilization produced a subset of individuals that were completely sterile (8%) or had drastically reduced numbers of reproductive cells (18%). Importantly, sterile individuals developed normally in all other respects: they showed no major differences in growth, sex steroid hormone levels, or survival under semi-commercial rearing conditions.\nKey findings include:\n\nTarget specificity: dnd expression was limited to gonads and unfertilized eggs, confirming its value as a marker for germ cell presence.\nNo adverse health effects: Sterile fish were physiologically indistinguishable from fertile fish in terms of somatic growth and overall condition.\nHigher efficacy pre-fertilization: The sterility induction was more effective when the treatment was applied before fertilization, likely due to increased permeability of the egg chorion.\n\n\n\nWhy It Matters\nThis method opens a new path for scalable, publicly acceptable sterility induction in marine finfish aquaculture. By eliminating the reproductive capability of escapees, it reduces ecological risk and helps safeguard the genetic integrity of wild populations—while also offering potential gains in growth efficiency and product quality for farmers.\nSablefish, already known for its rich flavor and high omega-3 content, now also stands to become a model species for innovative, sustainable aquaculture practices.\n\n\nWhat’s Next?\nThe authors emphasize that further optimization is needed to improve sterility rates and ensure consistent results across large-scale operations. Future research will likely explore different concentrations, immersion times, and additional species to assess broader applicability.\nBut for now, this work—driven by Dr. Yanagitsuru’s leadership—marks an important milestone in the development of non-GMO solutions to one of aquaculture’s biggest challenges.\nCitation:\nYanagitsuru, Y.R., Hayman, E.S., Fairgrieve, W.T., Zohar, Y., Wong, T-T., & Luckenbach, J.A.

    "section": "",
    "text": "In a recent meeting focused on gene expression analysis, we delved into the intricacies of examining expression at the exon level, a crucial but complex aspect of understanding gene function and regulation. The discussion provided deep insights into both the challenges and potential breakthroughs in the field of genomics. Here’s a detailed recap of the key points and future directions highlighted during the conversation.\n\n\nEmphasis on Gene Expression Analysis\nGene expression analysis remains a cornerstone of genomic studies, serving as a gateway to understanding the roles of genes in various biological processes and disease states. The meeting opened with a reaffirmation of the importance of mastering the techniques and tools that allow for such analysis, emphasizing that comprehensive understanding is necessary to advance research.\n\n\nWorkflow and Tools\nA significant portion of the discussion revolved around the workflow used in the analysis. The researchers outlined their use of HiSat for alignment—a choice reflecting HiSat’s efficiency in handling high-throughput RNA-seq data. StringTie was then introduced as the tool for identifying transcript units, highlighting its capability to assemble transcripts effectively. The differential expression analysis was conducted using DC2, a tool favored for its robust statistical methods in handling variance among biological replicates.\n\n\nChallenges in Interpretation\nOne of the central themes of the meeting was the challenge of interpreting results where genes do not show differential expression overall but do exhibit variations at the exon level. This scenario often leads to questions about alternative splicing or differential exon usage, which can have significant implications for gene function.\nThe group discussed several hypothetical situations:\n- Alternative Splicing: If only certain exons within a gene are differentially expressed, this might suggest alternative splicing, a process where the same gene can lead to different protein variants.\n- Alternative Start Sites: Differentially expressed exons at the gene’s boundaries might indicate alternative transcription start sites, affecting how transcription is initiated.\n\n\nBiological Implications and Interpretation\nThe biological implications of these findings are profound, potentially impacting everything from gene regulation to the development of therapeutic strategies. For example, alternative splicing can result in proteins with differing, sometimes antagonistic functions. Understanding these nuances is essential for the development of targeted therapies.\n\n\nThe Role of Visual Aids\nA noteworthy suggestion from the meeting was the use of visual aids to better explain complex data and analysis. Presentations with graphical representations of data can facilitate a clearer understanding, aiding in the interpretation of intricate patterns of gene expression that might otherwise be overlooked in raw numerical data.\n\n\nFuture Directions\nLooking to the future, the participants agreed on the need for more refined tools and methodologies to enhance the accuracy and granularity of exon-level expression analysis. They highlighted the potential for developing new computational tools that can integrate more complex layers of data, such as epigenetic modifications and non-coding RNA interactions, which could provide a more comprehensive view of gene regulation.\nThe meeting concluded with a sense of optimism about the path forward, acknowledging that while challenges remain, the ongoing advancements in technology and methodology will continue to illuminate the complexities of the genome.\nThis deep dive into exon-level analysis not only underscores the complexity inherent in genetic studies but also highlights the meticulous detail and sophisticated understanding required to truly grasp the implications of gene expression data. As researchers continue to unravel these complexities, each discussion and discovery adds a valuable piece to the puzzle of life sciences."

    "title": "Coral Larvae and Thermal Stress",
    "section": "",
    "text": "As climate change continues to drive rising ocean temperatures, coral reef ecosystems face an unprecedented crisis. Coral bleaching events, characterized by the breakdown of the mutualistic relationship between corals and their algal endosymbionts (Symbiodiniaceae), have become increasingly common, threatening the persistence of coral reefs worldwide. While much research has focused on adult corals, new studies are shedding light on how early life stages respond to thermal stress. A recent study by Huffmyer et al. (2024), published in PLOS Biology, provides novel insights into how coral larvae cope with increased temperatures by modifying nitrogen assimilation to stabilize symbiotic relationships and mitigate bleaching risk.\n\nThe Crucial Role of Coral Larvae in Reef Resilience\nReef-building corals rely on their symbionts to produce energy-rich photosynthates that fuel metabolic processes. However, when subjected to thermal stress, this delicate exchange can be disrupted, leading to the expulsion of symbionts and loss of critical energy sources. Understanding how coral larvae respond to environmental stress is particularly important, as their ability to establish symbiosis and successfully settle onto reefs determines the future of coral populations.\nThe study focused on Montipora capitata, a dominant reef-building coral in Hawai‘i that vertically transmits Symbiodiniaceae to its offspring. The researchers subjected symbiotic larvae to a 2.5°C increase in temperature for three days and assessed metabolic responses, photosynthetic performance, and stable isotope-labeled metabolite exchange.\n\n\nKey Findings: Nitrogen Assimilation as a Protective Mechanism\nContrary to expectations, the study found that while larvae exhibited significant metabolic depression under high temperatures—indicated by a 19% reduction in respiration rates—they did not experience bleaching or a decline in survival and settlement rates. Photosynthetic activity remained stable, and the symbiont population density was maintained despite thermal stress.\nA crucial discovery was that coral larvae increased ammonium assimilation and urea metabolism while sequestering nitrogen into dipeptides. This shift suggests that larvae actively modulate nitrogen cycling to maintain symbiotic balance. By limiting nitrogen availability to the symbionts, the coral hosts may be promoting sustained photosynthate translocation, ensuring that energy supply remains uninterrupted under heat stress.\n\n\nMetabolic Trade-offs and Implications for Coral Survival\nWhile glucose translocation from symbiont to host was maintained, the study revealed reduced metabolism of glucose through central carbon pathways such as glycolysis. This metabolic shift implies a trade-off: larvae prioritize nitrogen assimilation over carbohydrate breakdown, potentially conserving energy for essential physiological functions.\nThe authors propose that nitrogen limitation imposed on Symbiodiniaceae encourages continued carbon transfer to the host, preventing the symbionts from hoarding fixed carbon, which could otherwise disrupt the mutualistic relationship. This mechanism highlights a potential resilience strategy in coral early life stages that may influence reef recovery following bleaching events.\n\n\nFuture Directions and Conservation Implications\nUnderstanding the physiological mechanisms that allow coral larvae to withstand heat stress has significant implications for reef conservation and restoration efforts. If coral larvae can naturally modulate nitrogen metabolism to maintain symbiosis, selective breeding or assisted evolution approaches may enhance these traits in vulnerable species.\nAdditionally, further research should investigate whether similar nitrogen assimilation strategies are present in adult corals or if this is a life-stage-specific adaptation. Given the increasing frequency of marine heatwaves, identifying and promoting heat-resilient traits in corals could be a crucial component of future conservation strategies.\n\n\nConclusion\nHuffmyer et al. (2024) provide compelling evidence that coral larvae can mitigate thermal stress through nitrogen assimilation, maintaining stable symbiosis even under elevated temperatures. By uncovering this metabolic adaptation, the study advances our understanding of coral resilience mechanisms and underscores the importance of protecting early life stages in reef conservation efforts. As climate change accelerates, these insights may inform new strategies to support coral reef survival in a warming world."

    "section": "",
    "text": "In recent years, the Northeastern Pacific has been hit by a series of unprecedented marine heatwaves, notably “The Blob” from 2014-2016 and another in 2019, causing significant ecological disruptions. A compelling article titled “Beyond the Blob: Pinpointing the Mechanisms of Pacific Cod Population Decline” by the CICOES staff, delves into the alarming decline of Pacific cod populations in the Gulf of Alaska, a critical concern given the species’ ecological and economic significance.\nThe Pacific cod, a vital component of Alaska’s groundfish fishery, generating over $100 million annually, faced a dramatic 71% reduction in population between 2015 and 2017 surveys. This decline coincides with the marine heatwaves, raising urgent questions about the survival of early life stages of Pacific cod in a rapidly changing climate.\nResearchers from CICOES, the University of Washington’s School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences, Oregon State University, and NOAA are collaborating to unravel how increased temperatures impact Pacific cod. Their focus is on the vulnerable early life stages – developing eggs, larvae, and juveniles. Intriguingly, higher temperatures, while accelerating growth, also diminish liver size and alter key metabolic enzymes in young Pacific cod, hinting at deeper metabolic disruptions.\nOne innovative approach used by these researchers is RNA-Seq, a next-generation sequencing technology. It allows for a comprehensive analysis of gene activity, shedding light on how warming affects Pacific cod at a molecular level. Initial findings suggest that high temperatures during larval rearing disrupt lipid metabolism processes, potentially reducing energy availability, a crucial resource during this stage.\nThe ultimate goal of these studies is to identify the mechanisms driving the mortality of Pacific cod post marine heatwaves. If these mechanisms are more clearly understood, it could lead to the identification of populations or individuals with a better genetic and physiological predisposition to withstand warmer conditions.\nFor anyone interested in marine biology, climate change impacts, or fisheries management, this article is a must-read. It not only provides a deep dive into the challenges faced by Pacific cod but also highlights the cutting-edge research being conducted to safeguard these vital marine populations. To explore this topic further and understand the intricacies of this crucial research, I highly recommend reading the full article in the CICOES Magazine 2023 issue.

    "text": "Write up for this github issue\nGithub repo available here but each step’s chunk is also linked in workflow write up.\n\nThe Data\nThe RNA-seq data that was analyzed for this issue was from manila clam (Ruditapes philippinarum) samples of a control and treatment group. There were 15 control samples and 15 treatment samples, each with 2 reads. Each fasta file had the naming scheme M-?-###_R#_001 where ? = C (control) or T(treatment), ### = sample number, and R# = R1 (read 1) or R2 (read 2). Raw files can be found here.\n\n\nThe Workflow\n\nRetrieving Files From Gannet\nTo start the analysis, I retrieved the raw reads from gannet using wget.\nCode on Github\n\n\nChecking File Integrity via MD5sums\nTypically, the next step would be to check the file integrity by comparing the md5sums of the downloaded files with those on the remote server (gannet). However, the directory containing our reads did not have a text file of the md5sums for me to run md5sum on. So we skipped this step.\nCode on Github\n\n\nFastQC and MultiQC\nThe next step was to evaluate the quality of our sequences using FastQC and MultiQC. I generated a FastQC file for each of the reads, and then combined all of those using MultiQC to look at the quality of all of our reads together. The MultiQC report can be found here (note to view the “pretty version” you will need to download the html file and open the local file since github just shows the raw). Here’s some of the results from that:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSoftware Used:\n\nFastQC (v0.12.1)\n\nCode on Github\n\n\nPsuedo Alignment with Kallisto\nNext I pseudo aligned the reads and quantified expression using Kallisto. I did not trim prior to this as it is not wholly necessary for pseudo alignment. An index for alignment and quantification was created using a reference transcriptome for Ruditapes philippinarum (note: ensure to select for RNA file). Paired end reads for each sample were then aligned and quantified against this index.\nFollowing pseudo alignment and quantification, a trinity matrix was created with the Kallisto output to build an abundance matrix.\nSoftware Used:\n\nKallisto (Linux)(v0.50.1)\nTrinityRNAseq (v2.12.0)\n\nCode on Github\n\n\nDifferential Expression and Visualization with DESeq2\nUsing the quantification in the trinity matrix created, I ran DESeq2 to show deferentially expressed genes, and filtering for those who’s expression showed a difference with a p value &lt;= 0.05. Differential expression was also visualized via a volcano plot and heatmap of the top 25 deferentially expressed genes)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlong with the visualzations, I created a dataframe with the differentially expressed genes and associated statistics (base mean, log 2fold change, lfcSE, stat, pvalue, padj) and saved as a tab file for the next steps.\nSoftware used:\n\nBiocManager (v1.30.22)\nDESeq2 (v1.38.3)\npheatmap (v1.0.12)\n\nCode on GitHub\n\n\nIdentifying DEG Functions with Blastx\nOnce we had a tab file with differentially expressed genes, we could run blast on our reference genome (note: be sure to select for RNA file). Doing this creates a list of all of the genes (and gene short names) in our reference genome for us to get the names of our DEGs in the next step.\nSoftware used:\n\nNCBI Blast (v2.11.0)\n\nCode on Github\n\n\nJoining DEG with Blast Results and UniProt Gene Ontology Annotations\nUsing the file created from the reference genome Blast, I combined the Blast results with the DEG file by the common gene names. This dataframe contained the gene ID, gene short name, base mean, log 2fold change, pvalue, and padj. I isolated the UniProt IDs from the gene short names in order to retrieve the gene ontology (GO) annotations of interest.\nI looked up the annotations on UniProt’s web interface and saved the output as a tab file. Finally, I merged the Blast/DEG data frame with the GO data frame by the common UniProt ID’s/Entries to get a file of our GO annotations for the significantly deferentially expressed genes. The annotation file is available here.\nCode on Github\n\n\nGeneral (non-step specific) software and hardware info:\nComputer: 2016 MacBook Pro 8GB 13” with macOS Big Sur (v11.2)\nIDE: R Studio (v4.2.3)(via raven)"

    "section": "",
    "text": "As part of our ongoing commitment to fostering innovative research, this summer was particularly thrilling due to the strides made in the LSAMP Scientist Program. One of our standout projects, led by an ambitious student researcher, Colby Elvrum, brought new insights into the resilience of oysters against environmental stressors. Get a first hand account of all of Colby’s science from his notebook!\n\nThe Genesis of the Study\nOysters, a crucial component of aquatic ecosystems, serve as indicators of environmental health and sustainability. Recognizing their role and the urgent need to understand how environmental changes affect these organisms, we embarked on a project to utilize a novel application of the resazurin assay, traditionally a cell viability test in microbiology. This assay, which exploits the color-changing properties of the resazurin dye in response to oxygen consumption, was adapted to measure the metabolic activity of oysters under stress.\n\n\nWhat We Aimed to Discover\nOur research was driven by two pivotal questions: Can resazurin effectively measure metabolism in oysters, and does prior exposure to stress (stress hardening) alter their metabolic response to subsequent stressors? Through meticulously designed experiments, Colby led the charge in optimizing the assay conditions, ensuring the reliability and accuracy of our measurements.\n\n\n\nColby presenting his research at the Summer Research Symposium\n\n\n\n\nKey Findings and Methodological Innovations\nOur findings were enlightening. We observed that resazurin is not only a viable marker for oyster metabolism but also that it clearly illustrates the metabolic shifts caused by environmental stressors such as temperature fluctuations. Notably, oysters exposed to elevated temperatures displayed a rapid increase in metabolic rate, which was a precursor to subsequent mortality. This initial surge and later plateau in metabolism provided critical clues about the stress thresholds of these organisms.\nMoreover, the study also highlighted how oysters previously conditioned to withstand stress exhibited altered survival rates under extreme temperatures, suggesting a potential sensitization rather than hardening effect. These insights are crucial for understanding how oysters might respond to the escalating challenges of climate change.\n\n\nLooking Ahead\nThe implications of this research extend beyond the academic sphere. They beckon a reevaluation of how we manage and conserve our aquatic resources in the face of rapid environmental changes. The potential to scale up this assay and automate aspects of the procedure could revolutionize aquaculture, and provide a more dynamic understanding of environmental impacts on marine life.\n\n\nGratitude and Acknowledgments\nThis research was made possible through the support of the National Science Foundation. We are immensely proud of Colby and all associated researchers for their dedication and hard work.\nPoster (download hi-res pdf)"

Why this date? It is based on the 60th anniversary of American Astronomer and gay activist Frank Kameny’s fight against workplace discrimination, which he took to the U.S. Supreme Court.\nScience is a place of innovation, research, and progress, but many communities are still marginalized in these spaces. Pride in STEM notes that 28% of LGBT+ people have considered leaving their jobs because of discrimination or workplace hostility.\nOn LGBTQ+ in STEM Day, we celebrate the contribution of LGBTQ+ scientists, while also recognizing that barriers are still faced and that efforts have to continue to break these down. We spoke with SAFS graduate student, Aspen Coyle, who shared her thoughts on her journey so far in academia, what inclusion means for her, and some of the barriers and highlights she’s experienced. She also shares some advice for those concerned about a lack of representation in marine science."

Being queer in rural Alaska, especially around the fishing industry, is often met with confusion (and occasionally, mild hostility), but I never felt much of that from my coworkers.\nHere at SAFS, my lab is mostly other queer people, which has been wonderful. When I was living as a queer guy, it was really great to have a bunch of people around with this shared experience and perspective.

    "text": "A unique perspective. You will never guess what they reveal!\n\nAudio\n\n\n\nTranscript\nWelcome to The Deep Dive, where we dig into the nitty gritty of fascinating topics.\nToday, we’re taking a deep dive into the Roberts Lab at the University of Washington, and we’re doing that through the lens of their handbook.\nIt’s more than just a rule book, though, isn’t it?\nOh, absolutely.\nIt’s like a window into their whole approach to science.\nEverything from, like, groundbreaking research to how they actually build their research culture.\nAnd they’re known for being incredibly transparent, which this handbook really embodies.\nYeah, it’s refreshing.\nAnd speaking of refreshing, I have to ask you about this freezer alarm situation.\nOh, yes.\nSo they have, like, a dedicated alarm for their ultra-low temperature freezers, right?\nYeah.\nBut there’s this 15-minute delay before anyone actually gets notified if it goes off.\nCan you imagine?\nIt’s like a slow-motion heart attack for a researcher.\nRight.\nAll those precious samples.\nI’d be a wreck.\nIt really highlights the fragility of these biological materials they’re working with.\nRNA, proteins, these things have to be stored at, like, negative 80 degrees Celsius.\nWow.\nEven a short power outage could be disastrous.\nSo is that delay, like, a safety net to give the system a chance to recover?\nExactly.\nIt’s a calculated risk.\nThey’re trying to balance preventing false alarms while also, you know, protecting those invaluable research materials.\nMakes sense.\nYeah.\nAnd it seems like that emphasis on meticulousness, on minimizing risk, it really comes through in the whole handbook, especially when they talk about lab safety and chemicals.\nIt’s serious business.\nRight.\nLike with Arnazole RT, they’re very clear about it being corrosive, potentially harmful if you inhale it, even disposing of it.\nIt’s a whole multi-step process.\nWell, they’re dealing with some pretty potent stuff.\nIt underscores their dedication to, you know, not just scientific rigor, but the actual well-being of their researchers.\nAbsolutely.\nIt’s like they’re creating an environment where cutting-edge science can happen, but it can happen safely.\nSafety first.\nYeah.\nAnd that meticulousness, that doing things by the book, it goes beyond just lab safety, you know.\nRight.\nIt’s woven into their whole research philosophy, which makes you wonder, if they’re this careful with safety, how does that translate to, say, data management or collaboration?\nGood question.\nAnd as luck would have it, that’s exactly what we’re going to be digging into in the rest of this deep dive.\nYou know, it’s funny you should mention that because the next thing that really struck me about this handbook was their code of conduct.\nOh, interesting.\nHow so?\nWell, for one, it’s incredibly detailed, even for like their diversity, equity, and inclusion meetings.\nYou don’t always see that level of, I don’t know, formality in a lab handbook.\nWhat kinds of things are we talking about here?\nThey have these great phrases like, “Elevate impact above intent,” and, “Expect and accept non-closure.”\nLike, really specific guidelines.\nHuh.\nIt sounds like they’re trying to foster a very specific kind of research environment.\nRight.\nOne where people feel comfortable admitting they don’t know everything, which, let’s be honest, is most of the time in research, right?\nOh, absolutely.\nScience is all about embracing uncertainty.\nBut it takes a certain culture to really allow for that.\nTotally.\nAnd it seems like they’re putting a lot of emphasis on making sure everyone feels heard and respected, especially in those DEI meetings.\nWell, and that makes sense, right?\nIf you want to have those tough conversations about diversity and inclusion, you need to create a space where people feel safe to speak their minds.\nYeah.\nNo, you’re right.\nIt all ties together.\nAnd then there’s this whole thing about mentorship.\nThey really encourage lab members to have multiple mentors, not just one.\nThat’s interesting.\nMost labs I’ve seen, it’s pretty standard to have one primary mentor.\nRight.\nYeah.\nSo I thought that was really unique.\nIt kind of speaks to this idea of providing a well-rounded experience, right?\nAbsolutely.\nDifferent mentors bring different perspectives, different areas of expertise.\nIt can really enrich a researcher’s training.\nOkay, so we’ve got meticulous safety protocols, a very deliberate approach to their lab culture.\nBut we also know they’re dealing with a massive amount of data.\nLike their handbook mentions Nightingale for sequencing this whole network attached storage system called Gannett.\nDon’t forget the supercomputer.\nMOCs, was it?\nOh, right.\nMOCs.\nI mean, it’s a lot.\nIt really makes you wonder how they manage it all.\nIt’s a data tsunami.\nHow do they keep from drowning?\nWell, for one thing, they’re incredibly organized.\nLike religiously organized.\nGive me the details.\nThink detailed metadata for every single experiment, strict folder structures on their network.\nThey even have readme files.\nReadme files for every folder, seriously.\nSeriously.\nAnd it’s all part of this commitment to open science.\nThey want their research to be accessible, transparent.\nSo anyone could theoretically go in and understand their data, their methods.\nThat’s the idea.\nIt’s about breaking down those silos, you know, fostering collaboration, avoiding unnecessary redundancy, ultimately speeding up discoveries.\nIt’s kind of inspiring, actually.\nIt’s like they’re playing the long game, advancing science as a whole, not just their own work.\nExactly.\nBut okay, even with perfect organization, all that data analysis, it’s got to be intense.\nThey mentioned Jupiter notebooks in the handbook.\nRight, and mocks the supercomputer.\nAnd they even talk about using like the command line.\nHard course, so they’re not messing around.\nWell, they’re equipping their researchers with a seriously powerful toolkit.\nBut it goes beyond just the tech.\nThey even recommend this book, Getting Things Done.\nTime management.\nTime management.\nIt’s all about efficiency.\nThey don’t just give them the tools.\nThey give them the training, the resources to actually use them well.\nIt’s like they’ve thought of everything.\nYeah.\nAnd it doesn’t stop there.\nThey have a whole section on conferences, funding opportunities, even like travel grants.\nThey want their researchers to be well-rounded, right?\nNot just stuck in the lab, but out there presenting, collaborating, getting their work funded.\nIt’s impressive, I have to say.\nLooking at the Roberts Lab this way, through their handbook, you really get a sense of the thoughtfulness, the care that goes into building a successful research environment.\nIt’s not just about, you know, the results, the discoveries.\nIt’s the people, the culture.\nAnd that commitment to moving science forward in a way that’s open and collaborative, it’s really something.\nMakes you wonder what they’ll accomplish, what amazing discoveries are on the horizon for them.\nIt does, doesn’t it?\nAnd that’s something to ponder as we wrap up this deep dive into the world of the Roberts Lab.\nUntil next time, keep exploring, keep questioning, and keep diving deep."

    "section": "",
    "text": "In our latest study, we delved into the complex interplay between environmental factors and the immune responses of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) during infestations by sea lice (Caligus rogercresseyi). This research is particularly significant for both aquaculture and the management of natural marine ecosystems.\n\nOur Research Approach\nDr. Cristian Gallardos’ team set up an experimental infestation of Atlantic salmon with sea lice, controlling for variations in temperature and salinity: specifically, conditions were set at 8°C and 16°C, and 32 and 26 practical salinity units (PSU). We then collected tissues from these fish to conduct analyses via reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) and whole transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq).\n\n\nKey Discoveries\n\nImpact of Environment on Parasitic Load: We observed that the parasitic load varied significantly with environmental conditions, noting the lowest abundance of lice in salmon kept at cooler and less saline conditions (8°C/26PSU).\nTranscriptional Changes and Splicing Events: Environmental conditions were found to influence the salmon’s transcriptome profiles substantially. Notably, there was an increase in alternative splicing events in fish under low temperature and salinity, suggesting that environmental stress can induce genomic adaptations.\nMethylation Patterns: We also noted significant changes in methylation levels in response to temperature variations, with more pronounced differential methylation regions (DMRs) at the higher temperature of 16°C. These methylation changes correlated with the expression of alternatively spliced transcripts.\nBiological Pathways: Our analyses revealed significant correlations between methylation, transcript expression, and key biological pathways such as Ferroptosis and TLR signaling pathways, which are crucial for immune response and cellular integrity.\n\n\n\nImplications of Our Findings\nThis research highlights the nuanced ways in which environmental conditions can influence the genomic and epigenomic landscapes of marine organisms. For the aquaculture industry, understanding these dynamics is essential for developing effective management strategies to combat sea lice infestations, which are a major challenge for the sustainability and economic success of salmon farming.\nMoreover, the link between environmental conditions, alternative splicing, and methylation opens new research avenues into the genetic mechanisms of resilience and adaptability in marine organisms. This knowledge advances our understanding of how species adapt to their changing environments, which is critical for preserving and enhancing the health of our global marine resources."

These tiny organisms, often overlooked in genomic studies, are now at the forefront of revealing how life beneath the waves adapts, survives, and thrives in rapidly changing oceans.\nIn this post, we highlight key presentations that explored how DNA methylation, RNA modifications, and chromatin remodeling influence invertebrate development, stress response, and even intergenerational adaptation.\n\n\nMussels and Methylation Maps\nEnrico D’Aniello and colleagues presented the first high-resolution DNA methylation map in the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis. This map revealed key regulatory elements and tissue-specific methylation patterns, providing a baseline for understanding how gene expression is modulated in response to environmental shifts.\n\n\n\nModifications in Oysters\nIn Crassostrea gigas, Natacha Clairet demonstrated that m6A RNA methylation plays a pivotal role in neural development and transcript splicing. Her work showed that these epitranscriptomic changes are not only developmentally regulated but may also mediate environmental responses.\nBuilding on the oyster story, Guillaume Rivière showed that thermal stress leaves lasting epigenetic marks on oyster gill tissues. This “epigenetic memory” alters gene expression patterns in subsequent exposures, pointing to methylation as a resilience mechanism.\nMeanwhile, Sophie Valk examined oysters undergoing natural sex transitions, finding unique DNA methylation signatures in hermaphrodites. Her work hints at epigenetic regulation as a driver of reproductive plasticity.\nElyna Bouchereau from the University of Perpignan explored the methylome of Vibrio aestuarianus, a bacterial pathogen of oysters, revealing how epigenetic signatures may influence virulence and host interaction, while Amélie Dellong presented a multi-omics approach to decipher chromatin structure in Magallana gigas, offering new insight into the regulatory architecture of oyster genomes.\nMarta Pascual presented a population epigenomics study of Crassostrea gigas along the Iberian Atlantic coast, showing that DNA methylation patterns vary significantly between wild and farmed populations, suggesting a potential role in local adaptation and domestication.\nLénaig Boulard investigated the epigenetic responses of Pacific oysters to ocean acidification, demonstrating methylation changes in genes associated with shell formation and oxidative stress defense.\nCéline Cosseau explored transgenerational epigenetic inheritance in oysters, showing that environmental exposures in adult oysters can lead to stable methylation changes in offspring, particularly in stress-response genes.\n\n\n\nCorals and the Code of Light\nReef-building corals were another highlight. Kathleen Durkin described how miRNAs and lncRNAs shape coral development and immunity under heat stress. Kelly Gómez-Campo added that light exposure during development can modulate DNA methylation patterns and downstream gene networks in corals, underscoring how tightly environment and epigenome are interlinked.\nHollie Putnam presented a comprehensive study on the spatial and temporal dynamics of epigenetic regulation in reef-building corals, while Jill Ashey highlighted the critical roles of non-coding RNAs during early coral development, particularly in mediating the maternal-to-zygotic transition.\n\n\n\nHistone Modifications in Sea Anemones\nIn the heat-stressed sea anemone Exaiptasia diaphana, Mascha Dix presented findings on histone modifications (H3K27me3 and H3K4me3) as key players in regulating gene expression. These modifications allow rapid but reversible responses to changing thermal conditions.\n\n\n\nHypoxia and Neural Epigenetics in Sea Hares\nJavier Rodriguez-Casariego studied the sea hare Aplysia californica and showed that DNA methylation shifts in neural tissues under hypoxic conditions suggest a role for epigenetic plasticity in environmental stress tolerance.\n\n\n\nConclusion: Epigenetics as a Unifying Language\nThese studies collectively show that epigenetic mechanisms are not just molecular curiosities—they are central to how marine invertebrates sense, remember, and adapt to their environment. Whether through methylation, non-coding RNA, or histone marks, the language of the epigenome is being translated into actionable insights for conservation, aquaculture, and understanding evolution under climate change.\nEPIMAR2025 made one thing clear: the future of marine biology will be written in epigenetic code."

    "text": "Summary\nSummary: Across the globe, oysters need to rapidly respond to climate change. Increased concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) are warming and acidifying estuaries, especially along the south-eastern coast of Australia, at a rate an order of magnitude greater than that predicted for oceans (Collins et al. 2013; Scanes et al. 2020). For Indigenous Australians, oysters create an unbroken connection with the coast and sea that has persisted over time (National Oceans Office 2002) and are the focus of Aboriginal-led reef restoration projects. Assessing the capacity of oysters and other marine organisms to acclimate or adapt to global climate change stressors presents one of the most important research challenges of our time. Acclimation through the mechanism of transgenerational plasticity (TGP) is now at the leading edge of research providing hope that oysters and other marine organisms may persist into the future (Parker et al. 2012, 2015, 2017a, Gibbs et al. accepted a, b). This project takes the next critical step in research: to identify whether the TGP response of oysters differ across genotypes, the capacity of TGP responses to persist within and across generations, and the epigenetic mechanisms which underlie them. How well we understand this, will determine our ability to ensure marine food security into the future and to protect the cultural heritage of Indigenous Australians – identified as a major concern for Indigenous people (National Oceans Office 2002). Globally, oysters form large aquaculture industries worth $6.8 billion per annum (Food and Agriculture Organization 2014) and provide services vital to the ecosystem (Lemasson et al. 2017).\n\nAIM: Focussing on the ecologically, economically, and culturally important Sydney rock oyster, Saccostrea glomerata – we will use an innovative combination of state-of-the-art climate change mesocosm exposure systems and internationally established epigenetic and genetic techniques, with an ultimate aim to protect and conserve oysters against climate change to the benefit of Australians. Specific aims: Using the unique resource of pair-mated family lines of the Sydney rock oyster, S. glomerata, we will:\n1. Measure the variation in transgenerational plasticity responses to ocean warming and acidification within and among genotypes\n2. Characterise the role of epigenetic inheritance (DNA methylation) in transgenerational plasticity responses\n3. Assess the capacity of transgenerational plasticity responses to persist across life stages and generations"

    "text": "Summary\nShellfish are a key component of domestic seafood production. Shellfish aquaculture is one of the most economically important sectors of the US industry, with major species including oysters and clams. As is the case with all farmed species, there are a suite of desirable phenotypes that directly correspond to increased environmental and economic sustainability. The ability to identify genomic predictors of phenotype offer a framework to increase aquaculture production. In shellfish aquaculture key phenotypes continue to be resilience and stress tolerance. Understanding the physiological underpinnings of these phenotypes in oysters and clams has been a focus in our group. To this end we have archived hundreds of samples from families with diverse phenotypic responses to stress. For example, as part of one effort to examine the influence of ploidy on oyster stress tolerance we have Standard Metabolic Rate (SMR) and enzyme activity data on oysters that reveal diverse physiological profiles. In response to the NRSP-8 Small Funding Possibilities for US Aquaculture Groups, we are proposing to 1) identify genomic architecture variation contributing to desired phenotypes in shellfish and 2) develop a community platform to share data and analytical approaches. These objectives are in direct response to Program Objective 2: Advance genome-to-phenome prediction by implementing strategies and tools to identify and validate genes and allelic variants predictive of biologically and economically important phenotypes and traits. Additionally the proposed work will address Program Objective 1, by … providing a deep functional annotation of assemblies, and comparison across species to understand structure and function of animal genomes."

    "section": "Summary",
    "text": "Summary\nThe SORMI (Summer Oyster Resilience and Mortality Index) project addresses one of the most pressing challenges in shellfish aquaculture—recurrent summer mortality in Pacific oysters. For decades, oyster growers across the West Coast have faced sudden, large-scale summer die-offs linked to rising seawater temperatures, disease, and other stressors. These events threaten farm productivity and the economic stability of the shellfish industry.\nRather than focusing on why oysters die, SORMI takes a new approach by examining why oysters survive. The project will develop a generalized stress resilience index for Pacific oysters by integrating a suite of physiological and metabolic assays. This tool will help predict which oyster families are most resilient under real-world conditions, directly supporting breeding programs and hatcheries with a practical way to select for survival and reduce the frequency of catastrophic summer mortality events.\nAt the Roberts Lab, the team will lead development of innovative, high-throughput stress assays, including a new resazurin-based metabolic assay that has been refined as a cost-effective, scalable way to measure oyster metabolism. The lab will work closely with partners to analyze stress resilience across hundreds of oyster families and link these traits to field survival outcomes. The focus is on providing growers and breeding programs with actionable, science-based tools that are accessible and easy to implement.\nThe ultimate goal of SORMI is to give oyster growers a practical decision-making tool. With a reliable index, farmers could anticipate when their stocks are stressed and take proactive measures—harvesting before a mortality event, adjusting management practices, or prioritizing resilient broodstock. For breeding programs, SORMI will add a measurable, heritable trait that can accelerate development of hardier oyster lines."

    "section": "Summary",
    "text": "Summary\nChanging climate conditions, due to increasing releases of CO2 into the atmosphere, are causing warming of the world’s oceans. Changes in seawater temperatures are predicted to cause a shift in the distribution and a change in the abundance of most plants and animals. For most species, the magnitude of the impact, the potential for adaptation to future temperatures, and the mechanisms for adaptation are unknown. Features of parasite/disease ecology are also predicted to change as oceans warm, including susceptibility of hosts to disease, host ability to combat disease once infected, and alterations in pathogen virulence. Alaskan Tanner crab stocks, supporting fisheries worth $21 million in 2014, are expected to be significantly impacted directly and indirectly by warming temperatures. The Alaska Department of Fish and Game considers bitter crab disease, caused by a parasitic dinoflagellate, Hematodinium, to be the ‘principle threat’ to Alaskan Tanner crab stocks. Infection rates in the Bering Sea and southeast Alaska range from 2-5% and 0-100%, respectively. In heavily infected hosts, the meat is soft and chalky with a bitter taste, rendering the crabs unmarketable. The disease is believed fatal, although the time from infection to death remains uncertain. Recent worldwide spread of Hematodinium infections appears to have closely followed warming trends in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. We postulate that increased temperature in the North Pacific will physiologically stress Tanner crabs and also lead to increased prevalence of Hematodinium infections, either of which may lead to increased mortality in Tanner crabs. We propose to hold healthy and Hematodinium-infected Tanner crabs under different temperature regimes testing for a genetic response to infection and temperature. Our research will provide insight into the underlying mechanistic linkages between potential effects of climate change and important processes such as recruitment, growth and natural mortality on Alaskan Tanner crab stocks."

We have assembled an interdisciplinary team including aquaculture specialists, molecular physiologists, and single cell genomicists to tackle the critical initial step in this approach: the identification of genes involved in germ cell fate at the earliest developmental stages in geoducks. We anticipate identifying several germ cell- specific genes that when disrupted effectively turn off germ cell differentiation, yielding sterile products that do not undergo gonadogenesis, exhibit superior performance, and cannot disrupt genetic structure of ecosystems. Identification of these genes will be the measure of success for the proposed work. These gene targets will be the focus of future stages of research that determines how to best disrupt reproductive function without impacting growth performance."

    "text": "Summary\nAs the country comes to a reckoning on education and the environment, we are forced to interrogate the historic events that have led to such crises and how we can support inclusive solutions. Covid-19 has offered us an unprecedented glimpse into the challenges students face in the K-12 education system. It has also profoundly impacted socio-economically disadvantaged communities through the exposure of crippled or missing infrastructure. These same communities have been deliberately disconnected from building relationships with the natural world. In the face of complex problems like climate change, which will disproportionately impact these communities, we must act urgently to support the students who have historically been excluded from environmental science education. Our project starts with reconnecting community to environment, followed by engaging learners dynamically through the co-production of place-based knowledge. Although disadvantaged communities are highly engaged in climate change mitigation, this is often limited to anecdotes about water quality during trash pick-ups or community beautification projects led by outside non-profit volunteers, rather than building knowledge and strength within the community. Rarely do students have the opportunity to access their local environment through a non- problem solving lens and participate as equal partners. We want to change who is leading the learning as well as how the learning is done. Partnering with Sea Potential and Black in Marine Science, our team of scientists and digital arts experts will co-produce an arts based learning approach to increase environmental literacy in the communities most regularly overlooked. We will empower students to engage with the intertidal ecosystem, a defining feature of all coastlines and an accessible and dynamic place to learn about ocean science, organismal resilience, and community composition. Student projects will demonstrate how they understand the intertidal ecosystem, their connection to it, and its relationship to their home neighborhoods. Each of the projects will be presented to their academic and familial communities as well as used to create a teaching toolkit for local and national educators to replicate our art- and science-integrated student centered learning model for intertidal ecology."

We will test and implement shellfish performance enhancement methods through the use of environmental stressor preconditioning, or “hardening”. The objectives of this work are to A) Identify key stages in the geoduck life cycle when environmental conditioning can be applied for optimal benefits to productivity, including: – Broodstock conditioning and reproductive performance, – Larval growth and survivorship, and – Juvenile resistance to stress through repeated exposures, B) Use genomics and epigenomics to identify underlying mechanisms involved in enhanced performance. This will provide mechanistic information that enables the application of optimal preconditioning approaches in other shellfish species. This project directly addresses the research topics of genomics, quantitative genetics, and phenomics in the less studied, yet viable, geoduck clam. The proposed work is based on our group’s prior finding that some exposure to low pH conditions can improve larval and juvenile performance traits. The research proposed will integrate and further test these findings in a commercial shellfish hatchery setting and determine the genetic and epigenetic markers associated with improved performance. In addition, we will explore how the “memory” of prior exposure increases later performance such that epigenetic markers could be leveraged in broodstock management and hatchery practices. A number of phenotypes will be assessed, as well as the underlying genomic factors, including fecundity, survival, and growth."

Primarily, my laboratory’s research program is devoted to enhancing aquaculture practices in the Pacific Northwest, having received several research awards in collaboration with tribes, industry players, and conservation organizations.\nDespite having various projects involving shellfish transfer to the field for commercial or conservation purposes, budget constraints and directives in specific Requests for Proposals (RFPs) have hindered us from leveraging these opportunities to engage students and staff in fieldwork components. Thus, the purpose of this proposal is to request funds that would facilitate student and staff involvement in ongoing field grow-outs, thereby creating unique opportunities for SAFS community members. The funding will cover travel expenses, field sampling, and reagents and equipment for physiological analysis.\nOur partnerships span both local and regional scopes, enabling a range of experiences. For instance, local sites include shellfish farms in Puget Sound, as well as with sites associated with the MusselWatch program via UW Tacoma. These local sites provide a platform for integrating field research into courses like FISH 441/541 Integrative Environmental Physiology. Traditionally, the lab has exclusively engaged in lab-based environmental manipulation. However, this funding would enable us to shift focus to comparative studies across different field sites, offering students a more immersive experience in data collection and physiological assessment. Additionally, students would gain the invaluable experience of observing active aquaculture operations, providing them with practical insights into the application of their classroom knowledge. With some necessary constraints, students would be given the freedom to design their experiments. For instance, they could assess the stress response in oysters from two different field sites, formulating hypotheses to test based on natural conditions.\nMoreover, as part of a recent USDA award, we are dispatching oysters to commercial producers in Oregon. These field sites would provide an excellent framework for studies, which may be more apt for graduate students or scientific staff due to the need for accommodation. This experience would also illuminate the variations in environmental conditions and aquaculture practices across the region, fostering the expansion of research networks for our students."

It appears that many species are negatively affected by exposure to pH levels predicted to occur throughout their ranges under climate change.  The effects of OA include physiological consequences including decreased growth, altered embryonic development, reduced exoskeleton strength, increased metabolic rate, altered immune system, altered behavior, and increased mortality.  Environmental changes may select for adapted individuals, resulting in populations that are less vulnerable to OA than the current population. Estimating the degree to which acclimation and adaptation will alter the experimental effects of OA and combined effects with other stressors is thus critical to accurately predicting how these stressors will affect future fisheries yields.  We are using next-generation sequencing techniques to identify the specific alterations in the molecular, metabolic, and physiological pathways of individuals exposed to OA. We are looking for a post-doctoral researcher to perform bioinformatics on RNA transcriptomic data of Pacific cod and crabs exposed to OA conditions in an experimental setting. In addition, the researcher will be responsible for writing up their methods and results and drafting peer-reviewed manuscripts."

It is absolutely critical to understand how marine organisms, and industries that rely on them, will respond to these changing conditions. Arguably, it will be just as important to provide tools and best practices to mitigate these effects, and in the case of marine aquaculture – find solutions to increase sustainability of the sector broadly, to create resilience even in the face of environmental uncertainty. The overall goal of this research is to develop and test innovative solutions that the shellfish industry can use to increase the resilience of the industry in the face of rapidly changing environmental conditions. These solutions include explorations of alternative methods to produce sterile shellfish that may be more resilient to “summer mortality” and examining species diversification and environmental priming as two mitigation approaches that may increase the resilience of the industry in response to worsening OA conditions.  In this project, we will add capacity to collaborative research between partners at the University of Washington and the Northwest Fisheries Science Center, addressing objectives of key importance to the National Marine Fisheries Service mission.\nAlternative methods to induce sterility to support shellfish aquaculture\nReproductively sterile shellfish (i.e., those that cannot sexually mature and reproduce) are both a market driven need and an ecologically sustainable approach to mitigate concerns associated with genetic contamination of wild populations. Triploidy, the current method for reproductive control in shellfish, is costly in terms of both labor and time to develop selected lines, underdeveloped for many newer aquaculture species, and may have adverse effects on survival and performance. Concerningly, there have been increasing reports of “triploid mortalities” in the field, where triploid oysters experience high mortalities under multi-stressor conditions on farms.  A new method, with the potential to bypass the challenges associated with ploidy manipulation and enhance the ability to produce sterile shellfish is the induction of sterility by inactivating genes essential for germ cell formation and development, thus blocking gamete formation and fertility. This research will develop a means to produce sterile shellfish via germ cell elimination technologies.\nOA mitigation strategies for shellfish aquaculture\nThe aquaculture industry is already being threatened by climate change and ocean acidification (OA) in the Pacific Northwest. Two potential mitigation approaches exist that may allow the industry to remain viable in the face of worsening OA conditions. The first is to develop a portfolio of cultured species that includes those inherently resilient to OA and the second is to use husbandry practices that promote acclimation or adaptation of larvae via environmental priming of the parental generation. This research will explore both of these strategies through an investigation of OA sensitivity of the native littleneck clam (Leukoma staminea), whose OA sensitivity has not been thoroughly assessed. Additionally, this research will explore molecular mechanisms underlying parental carryover effects by comparing the transcriptional (gene expression) and lipid profiles of gametes collected from clam broodstock conditioned in high pCO2 versus control conditions. Not only will these activities allow for the assessment of littleneck clams as a potential novel, native species for culture, but will also provide integral data regarding the generalizability of parental carryover effects in response to OA broodstock exposures in bivalve shellfish.\nObjectives:\n1. Develop new technologies to achieve sterility in cultured shellfish species.\n2.           Assess OA sensitivity of the native littleneck clam and identify molecular mechanisms underlying parental carryover effects by comparing the transcriptional (gene expression) and lipid profile of gametes."

AquaMinev1.2 contains genomes of 37 aquatic species, including Arctic char, Atlantic salmon, California yellowtail, channel catfish, coho salmon, eastern oyster, giant tiger prawn, Nile tilapia, Pacific oyster, Pacific white shrimp, rainbow trout, striped sea bass and yellow perch. Annotation data includes RefSeq genes and additional data sources that may be available for each species, including Ensembl, KEGG, UniProt, Gene Ontology (GO), PubMed, and OrthoDB. Genes of human, fruit fly, owl limpet and zebrafish are included so model organism information can be leveraged using orthology. A precomputed orthology dataset called AquaMine-Ortho encompasses all species, including those not found in OrthoDB or Ensembl. New in AquaMinev1.2 is a comprehensive GO annotation dataset, covering all species, that can be used with a built-in gene enrichment analysis tool. AquaMinev1.2 also includes new genomic variant data from the Ensembl Variation Archive and RNA-seq-based gene expression levels for some species. We are currently developing new JBrowse genome browsers with Apollo manual genome annotation tools for the aquaculture species and will present the rainbow trout genome browser. We seek beta-testers from the research community to provide feedback on the AquaMine data mining tools and genome browsers."

    "text": "Summary\nThe proposed objectives cover the essential first steps toward generating sterile bivalves via molecular disruption of germ cell formation. The first step in the process is the identification of genes involved in primordial germ cell (PGC) specification in bivalves via single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA- Seq). This cutting-edge technique is particularly suited to identify germ cell markers in bivalves, since germ cell precursors represent a small number of cells in developing embryos. This information is integral to being able to control germ cell fate for reproductive sterilization of aquaculture species, and our proposed use of scRNA-Seq for directed application to aquaculture is both novel and potentially highly beneficial to the broader shellfish aquaculture community. Our first specific research aim is to characterize genomic processes involved in germ cell specification in Pacific oysters. A second fundamental step in the process is the optimization of techniques to deliver targeted, gene-regulating molecules to embryos to inhibit germ cell formation. Methods to optimize delivery techniques, including the use of CRISPR-Cas9 and morpholino constructs, have yet to be developed for bivalve embryos. Therefore, our second specific research aim is to optimize delivery techniques of custom gene-regulating molecules to oyster embryos. The completion of these objectives sets the stage for a more effective and sustainable approach for sterilization of shellfish."

    "text": "Summary\nLiving organisms may acclimate to environmental changes through epigenetic modifications to DNA, which alter the way genetic instructions are interpreted without altering the DNA code itself. While these modifications to organismal phenotype or function can be reversible, some of them may be inherited by offspring, potentially producing multiple, heritable outcomes from a single genome and affecting ecological and evolutionary outcomes. This project uses symbiotic, metabolically complex reef building corals as a model system to test the connections between physiological, epigenetic, and metabolic states, and predict how population and community dynamics are influenced by epigenetically-modulated phenotypes. This work will advance biological knowledge by delineating fundamental links (Rules of Life) between ubiquitous organismal energetic processes, epigenetics, and eco-evolutionary outcomes. The Broader Impacts activities parallel the project’s integrative approach, linking insights from Environment x Energetics x Epigenetics x Ecology for Education into an E5 platform. The E5 platform will provide i) early career STEM training, ii) local and global community education, and iii) educational resources for open science, quantitative approaches, and research reproducibility. Further, this E5 platform will train and inform the next generation of diverse scientists and public by combining local and global initiatives focusing on groups underrepresented in STEM.\nThis project examines how nutrient metabolism in the mitochondria generates cofactors and energy that will instruct the epigenetic machinery in the cell nucleus to modulate genome function to appropriately respond to environmental conditions. Environmentally-responsive metabolic function and energetic-epigenetic linkages act as drivers of complex emergent phenotypes. To elucidate relationships that are the basis for Rules of Life with respect to epigenetics, this project will use integrative experimental and modeling approaches focused on reef building corals to: 1) link nutritionally-provisioned metabolites with epigenetic and organismal state through seasonal sampling across environmental gradients; 2) expand current Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) models for symbiotic organisms to further integrate critical facets of nutritional symbiosis and calcification; 3) experimentally modulate metabolic and therefore epigenetic states through repeated exposure to increased temperature and nutrients, to test intra- and trans-generational epigenetic inheritance; 4) use DEB theory to identify shifts in energetics associated with epigenetic modulation, and link these sub-organismal processes to higher levels of organization; and 5) integrate findings into a generalizable, predictive eco-evolutionary model that links nutritional interactions, metabolic states, and subsequent epigenetic effects to the timescales regulating organismal processes and eco-evolutionary outcomes. This effort will provide characterization of environmental epigenetic phenomena in ecosystem-engineering marine invertebrates. This characterization includes determining the mechanisms and the degree of epigenetic ‘memory’ both within and across generations. By including information on environmental legacies, propagated by epigenetics, this project will advance both organismal and population-based models and improve capacity to predict responses to acute and chronic environmental signals."

To assess the potential for developmental plasticity to produce positive carry-over effects that improve resilience, we will expose oysters to a variety of environmental stressors at nonlethal levels during larval rearing. The performance of larvae will be assessed during early development and compared with performance after summer deployment at grow-out sites.\n\n\n\nfig\n\n\nObjective 2.

Transgenerational plasticity occurs when the environment experienced by parents influences the phenotype of their offspring (Fig. 4B). To assess the potential for transgenerational plasticity to produce positive carry-over effects that improve offspring resilience, we will expose oyster broodstock to a variety of environmental stressors at nonlethal levels prior to broodstock conditioning and spawning.

In particular, overwintering success of juveniles is hypothesized to represent a critical bottleneck with food availability the previous summer affecting juvenile lipid reserves and thus, their ability to survive winter. The physiological and transcriptional responses of Pacific cod and whether selective mortality is present under thermal stress are unknown. The proposed project will address these questions critical to their survival under climate change by identifying regions of the genome and epigenome that respond to thermal stress and starvation. Juvenile Pacific cod will be reared in three temperatures under feeding and non-feeding conditions, then an integrated genomic approach will identify genes, gene variants, and epigenetic markers that respond to thermal stress and confer resilience. To complement the genomic approaches and further investigate temperature influences on energy resources, we will perform lipid analyses. This work will inform predictions of genetic selection and molecular response of Pacific cod in the Gulf of Alaska under climate change."

The specific research and outreach objectives we will use to achieve this goal are:\nObjective 1. Determine susceptibility of Washington shellfish farms to heatwaves. Air and water temperatures experienced by oysters during grow-out will be monitored at farms within the Salish Sea and Willapa Bay in collaboration with industry partners. Continuous monitoring of environmental conditions in combination with oyster mortality data will be used to generate a climate risk assessment model for commercial growing areas within Washington State.\nObjective 2. Develop a commercially viable hatchery husbandry protocol that improves oyster heat tolerance. Oyster seed (“spat”) from OsHV-1 resistant families supplied by the USDA-ARS’ Pacific Shellfish Breeding Center (PSBC) will undergo sublethal exposure to simulated marine and aerial heat waves within a hatchery setting. The summer survival of stress-primed spat out-planted at farms with Puget Sound and Willapa Bay will inform the creation of a husbandry protocol that improves oyster climate resilience.\nObjective 3. Develop an enhanced workforce training curriculum for shellfish industry technicians. To address the industry’s need for skilled technicians, students from Bellingham Technical College’s (BTC) Fisheries and Aquaculture Sciences Program will be integrated into research objectives; this collaboration will be used to generate an enhanced workforce training curriculum that uses OsHV-1 and heat waves as case studies. Students will also gain exposure to training opportunities by serving as hatchery technicians, summer interns at shellfish farms, and student ambassadors during regular partner meetings."

To do this we will examine intergenerational effects of ocean acidification in the Manila clam, a globally cultured species that will serve as a model for marine bivalves and related taxa. By comprehensively investigating gamete status following parental pCO2 exposures, this project will uncover the non-genetic carriers of information across generations while simultaneously identifying factors that predict high performance of larvae in acidified conditions. By leveraging and working closely on a complementary NOAA supported project, we are able to expand our traditional research objectives with an objective centered around increasing diversity and inclusion in marine sciences. The specific objectives include 1) Characterize carryover performance in clams in response to ocean acidification, 2) Identify maternal macromolecule contribution of intergenerational plasticity and carryover performance, 3) Identify paternal epigenetic signatures associated with intergenerational plasticity and carryover performance, and 4) Develop inclusive educational experiences and products for underserved groups. The proposed work supports Washington Sea Grants commitment to cultivating partnerships and practicing a commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion. The objectives directly align with the critical program areas of Sustainable Fisheries and Aquaculture, Ocean Literacy and Workforce Development, and Healthy Coastal Ecosystems."

Here are a few.\n\nUW 10-week courses\n\n\nFISH 441/541 Integrative Environmental Physiology\n\n\nBoth freshwater and marine environments are continually changing in response to natural processes and human activities, putting stress on aquatic organisms from microbes to marine mammals. This course will explore the surprising similarities and unique differences in the physiological response organisms have to stress caused by factors as natural as tidal cycles, and as unnatural as excess pharmaceuticals. The course will take an integrative approach across disciplines linked to physiology, with an emphasis on molecular physiology and endocrinology; and assumes students have been introduced to basic physiological concepts in other coursework. The main focus will be on functional responses to system stressors; however, the course will also explore potential impacts at the population level, and the evolutionary implications of physiological response to environmental stress. Case studies and research papers will be used along with other readings.\n\nVisit Course\n\n\n\nFISH 546 Bioinformatics for Environmental Sciences\n\n\nThis course teaches core computing skills as well as project specific approaches. Each student will be developing and completing a research project targeting journal article submission by the end of the Quarter. There will be an emphasis on developing habits that increase automation which in turn will facilitate reproducibility. The primary course platform will be centered around GitHub, with each student creating their own repositories.\n\nVisit Course\n\n\n\nFISH 274 Introduction to Data Analysis for Aquatic Sciences\n\n\nData management skills are needed for entering data without errors, storing it in a usable way, and extracting key aspects of the data for analysis. This course will provide an introduction to data management, manipulation, and analysis, with an emphasis on biological problems. Class will typically consist of short introductions or question & answer sessions, followed by hands on computing exercises. The course will be taught using bash, R, and Jupyter Notebooks, but the concepts learned will easily apply to all other computational work. There will be an emphasis on reproducible research which includes the use of R markdown and version control. Students will need to come to class each week having completed the assigned readings. Once we learn how to import data, we will explore basic analysis procedures involving summarizing, gathering, spreading, filtering, separating, uniting, selecting, counting, random sampling, and performing basic arithmetic. The course will culminate in students identifying a data set, identifying a specific research question that can be answered with the data set, and communicate the findings in an effective visual manner. Work on these student projects will begin during week 6 of the course and students will present their work to the class during week 10.\n\nVisit Course\n\n\n\nFISH 521 Proposal Writing and Professional Development for Graduate Students\n\n\nThis class was originally designed to help students prepare research proposals. It has undergone various modifications since its inception, as different instructors have been placed in charge of it, and as the needs of students have changed. The course still includes the development of scientific ideas into coherent proposals, but it now also addresses other forms of communication, and aspects of professional development to help graduate students during and after their time at the University of Washington. Foremost, the current implementation of the course is primarily attributable to Dr. Mark Scheuerell who taught the course in 2022.\n\nVisit Course\n\n\n\nOne Week Courses\n\n\nEpigenetic Phenomena Connecting Climate Change and Coastal Marine Species\n\n\nThis one-week intensive graduate-level course explores the intriguing intersection of climate change, epigenetics, and marine invertebrate physiology, with a significant emphasis on the application of functional genomics. The course aims to highlight the substantial yet often overlooked role of marine invertebrates in coastal ecosystems, underlining their ecological significance and their responses to climate change at an epigenetic level.\nThe course starts by establishing a strong foundational understanding of epigenetics, climate change, and marine invertebrate physiology. Following this, students will delve into the intricate role of functional genomics in understanding these connections. Real-world examples will be extensively used to discuss how changes in climate directly and indirectly lead to alterations in the epigenetic mechanisms of various coastal marine invertebrates.\nBy the end of the course, students should have a comprehensive understanding of how climate change can influence the epigenetics and physiology of coastal marine invertebrates and the potential broader implications for marine ecosystems. The course is suitable for students with a basic understanding of genetics and climate science, although students from all disciplines are welcome as the course starts from foundational principles.\n\nVisit Course\n\n\n\nOther educational content\n\n\n\nTusk (Things you should know)\n\nVisit Resource\n\n\n\nLab Handbook\n\nVisit Resource",

    "section": "",
    "text": "In our latest update on the Pacific cod juvenile temperature study, we've gained deeper insights into how these remarkable fish respond to different temperatures. This research is part of a larger effort to understand the resilience of marine species in changing environments.\nGenetic Insights Reveal Population Origins\nWe began with genetic analyses, using data from thousands of genetic markers to determine the origin of our experimental fish. All our test fish were linked to the spawning grounds in the western Gulf of Alaska (wGOA) and the Eastern Bering Sea (EBS). This finding allows us to focus on the thermal resilience of cod from this particular region, which is vital as they face shifts in temperature in their natural habitats.\n\nTemperature's Role in Energy and Lipid Storage\nOur collaborator Louise Copement analyzed liver lipids in these juvenile cod, focusing on triglycerides and other key lipid types that are crucial for overwinter survival. The results showed a clear trend: energy storage, primarily in the form of triglycerides, peaked at 9°C, then dropped sharply at higher temperatures, especially at 16°C. This suggests that extreme warmth could deplete essential energy reserves, reducing the fish's survival prospects in the cold winter months.\n\nOptimal Growth Temperatures and Physiological Responses\nWe also observed that juvenile cod exhibit optimal growth at approximately 12.3°C, slightly higher than previous findings. With higher temperatures, growth rates plateau or decline, mirroring the energy storage patterns. Interestingly, the gene expression data from liver tissues revealed significant temperature-driven shifts, especially in energy production, lipid metabolism, and immune response genes. This molecular data adds a new layer to our understanding of temperature tolerance.\n\nIntegrated Data: A Pathway to Genomic Resilience Markers\nCombining growth, lipid, and gene expression data, we've started identifying genes that correlate with enhanced resilience at specific temperatures. This approach could spotlight genetic markers for thermal resilience, offering clues about cod populations best suited to future ocean conditions.\nIn summary, this research underscores the delicate balance juvenile Pacific cod must maintain in their energy reserves and growth under variable temperatures. These findings will help guide conservation and management efforts as we work to protect Pacific cod populations in a warming world."

    "title": "Exploring the Non-Coding RNA Landscape in Reef-Building Corals",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Coral reefs are among the most biodiverse ecosystems on the planet, yet they are increasingly threatened by climate change and human activities. Understanding the molecular mechanisms that govern coral resilience is crucial for their conservation. A new study by Ashey et al. (2025) provides a groundbreaking look into the non-coding RNA (ncRNA) repertoire of reef-building corals, shedding light on how these regulatory molecules contribute to coral gene expression and environmental adaptability.\n\nWhy Non-Coding RNAs Matter\nLong dismissed as “junk” DNA, ncRNAs have emerged as vital regulators of gene expression across all domains of life. Unlike protein-coding genes, ncRNAs do not translate into proteins but instead play critical roles in controlling genetic pathways, chromatin organization, and stress responses. In corals, these molecules could be key players in their ability to withstand environmental stressors such as rising ocean temperatures and pollution.\n\n\nThe Study: A Comprehensive Analysis of Coral ncRNAs\nAshey et al. conducted the first large-scale characterization of ncRNAs in three ecologically significant coral species from Mo’orea, French Polynesia: Acropora pulchra, Pocillopora tuahiniensis, and Porites evermanni. These species exhibit diverse physiological traits and symbiotic relationships, making them excellent models for studying ncRNA variation.\n\nKey Findings:\n\nDiverse ncRNA Repertoires: The study identified a broad array of ncRNAs, including long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), microRNAs (miRNAs), and piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), indicating that corals possess a complex ncRNA regulatory system.\nLimited Conservation Across Species: While a few miRNAs (such as mir-100) were conserved across all three species, most lncRNAs and other ncRNAs exhibited high evolutionary turnover, suggesting species-specific adaptations.\nFunctional Insights: Many ncRNAs were associated with immune regulation, stress response, and genomic stability. For example, lncRNAs were often found near immune-related genes, while piRNAs were enriched in transposable element regions, which are crucial for maintaining genomic integrity.\nmiRNA-Target Interactions: The study predicted miRNA targets involved in immune response pathways and cellular stress mechanisms, providing new insights into how corals regulate gene expression in response to environmental changes.\n\n\n\n\nImplications for Coral Resilience\nThese findings underscore the importance of ncRNAs in coral biology. By regulating gene expression and protecting genome stability, ncRNAs may influence corals’ ability to acclimate to shifting environmental conditions. This research also sets the stage for future studies on the role of ncRNAs in coral bleaching, symbiosis dynamics, and adaptation.\n\n\nFuture Directions\nGiven the rapid decline of coral reefs worldwide, understanding the molecular underpinnings of coral resilience is more critical than ever. Further investigations into ncRNA functions across additional coral species and environmental conditions will enhance our ability to predict and mitigate the impacts of climate change on these vital ecosystems.\n\n\nFinal Thoughts\nThe study by Ashey et al. provides a significant step forward in coral molecular biology, revealing how ncRNAs contribute to the complex regulatory networks that sustain coral health. As researchers continue to explore these molecular mechanisms, such insights could inform conservation strategies aimed at preserving coral reefs in a warming world.\nFor more details, the full study is available on bioRxiv: https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.03.15.643469."

The study has recently been published in bioRxiv and sheds light on the mechanisms underlying population-specific responses of Olympia oysters (Ostrea lurida) to ocean acidification. This research is groundbreaking in illustrating how different populations of the same species can exhibit varying levels of resilience to environmental stressors like acidification, a crucial factor for both conservation and marine food system sustainability.\n\n\nOcean acidification is a growing concern that is having a detrimental impact on marine ecosystems globally. The increased levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere are dissolving into our oceans, lowering their pH levels. Marine organisms like oysters are particularly vulnerable to such changes, as they rely on carbonate ions to build their shells. Understanding how different populations of marine species respond to this issue is key for effective conservation strategies and sustainable marine food systems.\n\n\n\nThe study focused on three phenotypically distinct populations of Olympia oysters from Dabob Bay, Fidalgo Bay, and Oyster Bay, bred and reared in common conditions over four years. The team assessed various aspects such as growth, reproductive development, and transcriptional responses to ocean acidification within and across these populations.\n\n\n\n\nDabob Bay Population: Exhibited the slowest growth but had high survival rates. This population also mounted the largest transcriptional response to acidification without affecting its growth and reproduction.\nFidalgo Bay Population: Exhibited the fastest growth rate but had the lowest fecundity. This population showed a moderate transcriptional response to acidification.\nOyster Bay Population: Had the highest fecundity but the lowest survival rates. Interestingly, this population did not respond at the transcript level and was the only group where acidification negatively affected growth and reproductive development.\nNext Generation Impact: Acidification did not affect gene expression in the larval stage for any population, although the Oyster Bay population produced larger larvae, which might partly mitigate the negative effects of acidification.\n\n\n\n\nThe findings are revolutionary for several reasons:\n\nConservation Implications: Populations with distinct resilience levels offer natural reservoirs of biodiversity that can be targeted for conservation efforts.\nFood System Sustainability: Understanding population-specific traits can help in developing more resilient aquaculture practices.\nGenetic Insights: The study identified specific genes in the Dabob Bay population related to antibacterial and antiviral processes, metabolism, growth, and reproduction, providing crucial clues into the mechanisms of stress tolerance.\nMicroscale Variability: The research underscores that distinct physiotypes can exist among marine invertebrate populations even on small geographic scales, which has far-reaching implications for species resilience to environmental stressors.\n\n\n\n\nThe research paves the way for future studies that can focus on leveraging these population-specific responses for the betterment of marine ecosystems and human needs.

Please read the full article here.\n\nMarine science mentoring over the summer at FHL\nSpending the summer at Friday Harbor Labs (FHL), SAFS grad student Chris Mantegna mentored four students – two as part of the NSF-funded Research Experience for Undergrads-Blinks (REU) program and two as part of the Doris Duke Conservation Scholars Program (DDCSP). During the program, students get to collaborate on a research project with their scientist-mentor to build marine research skills.\nSpecifically geared towards enhancing diversity within the marine sciences, the program welcomes students from underrepresented groups. This year, Chris’ students came from institutions across the US, including Kentucky, Massachusetts, Vermont and North Carolina, to work with her on an intertidal monitoring survey on Yellow Island in the Salish Sea.\n\n\n\nOchre sea stars (Pisaster ocherous) found on the island at low tide.\n\n\nThe REU-Blinks program based out of FHL takes advantage of the pristine environment, remarkable biodiversity, and the scientific and technical resources available at the marine science research facility. The DDCSP program aims to increase diversity in conservation work and allows students from all over the US a chance to participate in a two-year program where second year scholars participate in an onsite internship of their choosing.\nYellow Island is a nature preserve that The Nature Conservancy purchased in 1980, that also doubles up as a marine reserve, with no boating or fishing allowed within 300 yards of the island. The island is being used by Chris and the research team as a proxy for health in the wider Salish Sea due to the lack of human disturbance.\nAs part of a wider program sponsored by Black In Marine Science(BIMS) and The Nature Conservancy, Chris restarted a monitoring project to get a better idea of the biodiversity on the island, and this kicked off last year in 2022 with a pilot program nailing down methods for collecting data. This year, with her mentees, the team collected a full season of data, complemented with eDNA work.\ncontinue reading here."

    "section": "",
    "text": "In the meticulously orchestrated world of marine science, a groundbreaking experiment has unfolded in the hands of Eric Essington, casting the spotlight on an unlikely protagonist: the oyster. This narrative begins with the arrival of 235 adult oysters from Pacific Hybreed, their sizes ranging impressively from 40 to 100mm, and further complemented by a diverse younger contingent—120 juveniles, 120 seed, and approximately 120 spat, all courtesy of the USDA’s 2023 spawn.\nThe experimental setup divided these oysters into two groups: one destined for a control tank, mirroring their natural aquatic environment at a serene 17ºC, and the other for a treatment tank, where conditions were significantly altered. The latter group was subjected to a deliberate increase in temperature, a gradual ascent of 2ºC per hour until the water reached a stress-inducing 26ºC, maintained for six hours daily over a seven-week span (began 10 2 2023, ended 11 21 2023). This thermal regimen aimed to simulate the increasingly erratic and harsh conditions wrought by climate change.\n\nAdding a layer of complexity, adults and juveniles were subjected to mechanical stress, an innovative use of a salad spinner for 15 minutes on selected dates (10/2/2023, 10/4/2023, 10/11/2023). This unusual methodology aimed to mimic the physical disturbances oysters might face in their natural habitats, from tumbling in currents to encounters with predators and debris.\nThe culmination of this phase was marked by a meticulous sampling process on November 21, 2023. Selected groups of oysters were divided for detailed analysis, with some undergoing immediate tissue sampling for RNA and DNA analysis, while others faced an additional stress test—a 30-minute immersion in 32ºC water followed by a tumbling session in the salad spinner. This process was designed to simulate an acute stress event, allowing researchers to gauge the oysters’ physiological responses to compounded stressors.\nSeveral months later, on February 28, 2024, the experiment was revisited with a focused approach. This time, the younger generation of oysters was spotlighted, undergoing tissue sampling without the prior mechanical stress, to isolate the effects of thermal stress.\n\nTake-away to date - Stress hardening in spat in October and November resulted in increased growth compared to controls in February.\nThis experiment is not merely an investigation into the resilience of oysters to thermal and mechanical stress; it’s a narrative about adaptation, survival, and the intricate dance of life beneath the waves.\nSee Eric’s Post for more details."

    "section": "",
    "text": "During this past year a series of hatchery-based environmental conditioning activities (referred to as hardening) were completed with oysters out-planted onto three farms to evaluate performance. Additionally, climate resiliency was assessed in hardened oysters under controlled conditions.\n\n\n\nExperimental Overview\n\n\n\nFarm Outplanting\nEarly in the season, a cohort of oysters were subject to (a) daily thermal hardening for approximately two weeks prior to out planting in hanging bags on a farm in Sequim Bay, alongside a control group. These oyster will be assessed in early Autumn 2024. Later in the season oysters were subjected to a more diverse series of hardening conditions with oyster split between two commercial farms, one located in Willapa Bay and a second in the San Juan Islands. The combination of age classes and hardening conditions were as follows: b) small seed / daily thermal hardening, c) adult / daily thermal hardening, d) small seed / weekly thermal hardening, e1) large seed / weekly thermal hardening, e2) large seed / weekly zero salinity hardening. These hardening activities spanned from several weeks to months. For all hardening efforts controls were also outplanted. Oysters out planted in Willapa Bay will be assessed for survival and growth in early September 2024. Oysters out planted in the San Juan Islands have be subject to more routine monitoring. At this site we are currently observing a trend where oysters subjected to the daily hardening regime are surviving better than controls.\n\n\n\nWescott Bay Outplanting\n\n\n\n\nPhysiological Assessment 1\nTo assess the effectiveness of hardening within a hatchery setting, four ages classes of oysters were examined: adults (40-100mm), juveniles (20-55mm), seed (6-15mm), and spat ()1-6mm). In order to assess hardening potential and environmental memory, oysters were subject to an initial chronic temperature stress, then subjected to a secondary stress to see if the response to secondary stress was impacted by initial exposure. During the chronic temperature stress period, oysters from each age class were exposed to a daily 25ºC temperature spike. This repeated for 14 days starting on October 1. Control oysters from each cohort were maintained at an ambient temperature of approximately 17ºC during the same time period.\n\n\n\nHardening and acute stress temperature timeline\n\n\nAdult oysters in stress conditions were also subject to mechanical stress at day 1, 7, and 48, which was induced by 15 minutes. At day 147 (7 weeks after initial chronic stress), both stressed and non-stressed adult, juvenile, spat, and seed were subjected to a secondary stress of 30 minutes in 32ºC. Gill tissue was sampled immediately after and placed into RNAlater. Spat and seed that were too small to dissect gill tissue were sampled whole with all tissue used in gene expression assays. To date we have analyzed gene expression data from seed and spat. There was no mortality during this trial. Hardening increased growth (compared to controls) in spat. Further there was a reduced transcriptional response in spat. These data suggest temperature hardening of spat could result in a resiliency to later temperature stress whereby energy resources could favor growth.\n\n\n\nGrowth Performance\n\n\n\n\n\nGene expression profiles (spat)\n\n\n\n\n\nSchematic physiology explanation when hardened spat are exposed to acute temperature stress.\n\n\n\n\nPhysiological Assessment 2\nIn a second experimental regime, juvenile oysters were subjected to four hardening conditions 1) high temperature (35°C), 2) high temperature and freshwater, 3) freshwater, and 4) poly I:C immersion. These were exposures that occurred every other day for about 3 weeks. Approximately 1 month after hardening, oysters were brought to the lab and subjected to metabolic assessment using resazurin at 18°C and 42°C. Resazurin is a dye that is commonly used in cell viability, and it works by changing color as an organism consumes oxygen. Survival was assessed during the resazurin assay and 24 hours later. To date, our analysis suggests metabolic activity of the 42°C oysters was higher in the control oysters than previously hardened oysters. In the near future we will assess the relationship of metabolic activity and survival however it appears higher metabolic rate directly correlates with mortality. Taken together these sets of controlled experiments suggest hardening does have an impact on resiliency, though dependent on age, hardening duration, and subsequent environmental conditions."

The secret to its resilience lies in its genetic code, a treasure trove of information until now largely uncharted.\n\n\nIn a groundbreaking study, researchers have presented the first chromosome-level genome assembly for a Mytilidae family member in South America.

It’s a leap forward in our understanding of this species, providing a detailed map of the genetic factors that contribute to its survival and adaptation in a changing marine environment.\n\n\n\nImagine having a detailed instruction manual for building and maintaining an organism, one that could tell you how it can survive freezing waters, resist certain pathogens, or how it might react to the shifting chemistry of its habitat. That’s what a genome assembly provides. For aquaculture, this information is invaluable. It can lead to the development of hardier mussel strains, inform conservation efforts, and enhance the industry’s sustainability.\n\n\n\nThe aquaculture industry relies heavily on mussel farming, but it’s an enterprise not without its risks. With seeds collected from natural beds and translocated to varied farming conditions, the industry has been seeking ways to reduce losses and improve yields. The newly unveiled genome paves the way for breeding programs that can select for desirable traits, such as disease resistance or faster growth rates, potentially revolutionizing mussel farming.\n\n\n\nBut the implications of this research extend beyond the realm of economics.

Pacific oysters are economically vital to aquaculture industries and ecologically foundational to coastal ecosystems, yet they face increasing threats from climate change-induced stressors.\nThrough a carefully controlled experiment using oysters from the Point Whitney Shellfish Hatchery, Genevieve tested whether low pH or reduced salinity exposure would compound mortality under acute thermal stress. Her findings showed that, surprisingly, these prior stressors did not significantly impact thermal tolerance. This suggests that Pacific oysters may be energetically adapted to the variable conditions of the Pacific Northwest, offering a glimmer of hope for aquaculture resilience in the face of climate extremes.\n🔗 Watch Genevieve’s full presentation on YouTube\n📄 Download Genevieve’s Presentation Slides (PPTX)\n⸻"

    "title": "Using Metabolomics and Lipidomics to Unlock Marine Resilience",
    "section": "",
    "text": "How do marine organisms adapt to an ocean that is rapidly warming, acidifying, and changing in countless other ways? A new Perspective article in Integrative and Comparative Biology by Yaamini R. Venkataraman and Ariana S. Huffmyer takes on this pressing question by focusing on metabolic plasticity—an organism’s capacity to adjust how it produces, allocates, and uses energy under stress.\nThe authors argue that while genomics, transcriptomics, and epigenomics have all advanced our understanding of stress responses, metabolomic and lipidomic approaches provide a direct lens into energy balance—a key driver of resilience. By quantifying the molecules that fuel and regulate cellular processes, researchers can uncover hidden physiological shifts that are invisible at the whole-organism level.\n\n\nWhy This Matters\nMarine ecosystems are on the front lines of climate change. From corals to clams, invertebrates must constantly adjust to stressors like heat waves, hypoxia, and ocean acidification. The paper highlights how metabolic and lipidomic tools can:\n\nDetect subtle but critical energy shifts before mortality occurs.\nReveal differences in resilience between species, populations, and even sexes.\nProvide early biomarkers of stress tolerance that can inform conservation and aquaculture.\n\n\n\nA Framework for Best Practices\nRecognizing that metabolomic and lipidomic studies are still emerging in marine biology, Venkataraman and Huffmyer provide a roadmap for experimental design and analysis. Their recommendations include:\n\nCareful sampling and preservation to prevent artifacts.\nStrategic use of targeted, semi-targeted, or untargeted analyses.\nEmbracing time series designs to capture dynamic shifts.\nIntegrating molecular data with physiological and phenotypic metrics.\n\nThey also call for multi-omic integration—combining metabolomics and lipidomics with gene expression, epigenetics, and physiology—to link molecular mechanisms with whole-organism outcomes\n\n\nLooking Ahead\nThe Perspective synthesizes findings from 68 studies published between 1993 and 2025, showing both how far the field has come and where opportunities lie. Importantly, it underscores that the marine science community must embrace metabolic complexity if we are to anticipate and mitigate the impacts of climate change on ecosystems.\n\nBy providing this framework, Venkataraman and Huffmyer hope to spark more rigorous, reproducible, and integrative research—work that can help answer one of the defining questions of our time: how will marine life persist in a rapidly changing ocean?\n👉 Read the full article here: Interrogating Metabolic Plasticity in Marine Organisms: A Framework for Best Practices Using Metabolomic and Lipidomic Approaches"

    "title": "Cracking the Code of Pacific Cod",
    "section": "",
    "text": "What if the future of an entire fish population hinged on tiny changes in their DNA? In the frigid waters of the North Pacific, juvenile Pacific cod are facing an uncertain future as ocean temperatures rise. Our research is uncovering how these fish respond to warming waters—at the molecular level—and what that means for their survival.\nThe Science Behind Survival\nAt first glance, Pacific cod might seem like just another fish. But beneath the surface, their genetic makeup holds clues to how they adapt—or struggle—when faced with environmental stress. In our latest study, we’re diving deep into the connection between a cod’s genes and its ability to thrive in different temperatures.\nWe analyzed DNA and gene activity (transcriptomics) in young Pacific cod exposed to a range of temperatures, from icy 0°C to a heatwave-like 16°C. By combining this “genome-to-phenome” data—essentially linking genetic information to physical traits—we’re beginning to see which fish have the genetic tools to survive in a warming world.\nA Genetic Blueprint for Resilience\nOne of the most intriguing findings comes from a process called Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS), where we scan the entire genome for small genetic differences linked to key traits. One of the most revealing traits we studied is the hepatosomatic index (HSI)—a measure of how much energy a fish stores in its liver. Since fat storage is critical for surviving harsh winters, understanding which fish can accumulate liver lipids under stress is essential.\n\nOur data revealed specific genetic variants linked to liver size, some of which are connected to genes regulating appetite and metabolism. One gene in particular, likely involved in serotonin signaling (which affects hunger), seems to influence whether a juvenile cod stores enough fat when temperatures rise.\nCan Genes Predict Performance?\nBeyond genetics, we also examined how gene expression (RNA activity) relates to fish growth and condition. We identified a set of genes that are highly active in the strongest, most resilient fish under warm conditions. This genetic “signature” could help scientists predict which fish populations are best suited to handle climate shifts.\n\nBy looking at composite performance indices (CPI)—which combine growth rate, body condition, and liver fat content—we found a distinct pattern: some fish are naturally equipped to thrive in warming seas, while others may struggle.\nA Look to the Past—and the Future\nTo understand if these genetic traits have changed over time, we’re also analyzing historical samples from Pacific cod collected near Kodiak, Alaska, dating back to 2008. This will help us determine if recent marine heatwaves have already begun shaping the genetic makeup of young cod. If we find shifts in key genes over time, it could be a sign that natural selection is at work—favoring fish that can cope with temperature extremes.\nNext Steps: From Lab to Ocean Conservation\nRight now, we’re fine-tuning our analyses and comparing our results with other research teams, including NOAA scientists studying broader environmental factors. Our goal? To pinpoint the most critical genetic regions that influence temperature tolerance—and ultimately, to inform fisheries management strategies that support the resilience of Pacific cod populations.\nAs marine heatwaves become more frequent, understanding these genetic adaptations is more than just an academic pursuit. It’s about safeguarding a vital species in the face of climate change—ensuring that Pacific cod, and the people who depend on them, have a future in our warming oceans.\n\nProducts this period: \n\nMethods and preliminary results were presented by Laura Spencer at the NOAA NWFSC Manchester Research Station monthly meeting on December 11th, 2025, link to slides. \nMethods and preliminary results were presented by Laura Spencer at the NOAA AFSC groundfish seminar on December 17th, 2024, link to recording, link to slides.\nMethods and preliminary results were presented by Laura Spencer during the poster session of the Alaska Marine Science Symposium on January 27th, 2025 in Anchorage, AK, link to poster.\nLaura Spenccer’s lab notebook updates on analyses, lab work, and products, link to notebook.\nTechnical Report."

    "section": "Why Genomics Matters for Shellfish",
    "text": "Why Genomics Matters for Shellfish\nShellfish farming is a cornerstone of coastal economies, providing a sustainable protein source while contributing to water filtration and habitat structure. However, challenges such as disease outbreaks, climate change-driven stressors (e.g., ocean acidification, salinity fluctuations), and genetic bottlenecks in breeding programs pose significant hurdles. The integration of genomics and multi-omics approaches is helping researchers and industry stakeholders address these issues head-on.\n\nAdvancing Reference Genomes for Shellfish\n\nOne of the key priorities identified in the review is the need for high-quality genome assemblies for shellfish species. Reference genomes serve as blueprints for breeding programs, guiding selective breeding efforts toward desirable traits such as disease resistance, growth efficiency, and stress tolerance.\nFor instance:\n\nThe Pacific oyster (Magallana gigas) and Eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) now have improved genome assemblies, which are crucial for mapping genes associated with disease resilience.\nStructural variations in oyster genomes have been linked to breeding success, helping hatcheries refine their selection of broodstock.\nFunctional annotation efforts, like those undertaken by the international FAANG (Functional Annotation of ANimal Genomes) initiative, are improving our understanding of how genes are regulated in response to environmental stressors.\n\n\nMulti-Omics Approaches: Beyond the Genome\n\nWhile genomic sequencing provides a foundational understanding of shellfish biology, integrating other “omics” layers—epigenomics, transcriptomics, and microbiomics—adds depth to the picture.\n\nEpigenomics & Environmental Adaptation: Studies have shown that DNA methylation plays a key role in how oysters respond to stress, such as changes in salinity and temperature. This suggests that breeding for resilience might not just be about genetics but also about harnessing heritable epigenetic modifications.\nTranscriptomics & Disease Resistance: RNA sequencing has revealed that oysters activate specific immune pathways when exposed to pathogens like Perkinsus marinus (which causes Dermo disease). Understanding these pathways helps identify candidate genes for selective breeding.\nMicrobiomics & Shellfish Health: The microbial communities living on and inside shellfish significantly impact their growth and survival. Some studies suggest that manipulating the oyster microbiome could enhance disease resistance.\n\n\nGenomic Selection & Breeding Programs\n\nTraditional shellfish breeding has relied on mass selection or family-based selection, which can be slow and inefficient. Genomic selection—where DNA markers are used to predict an individual’s breeding value—has revolutionized selective breeding in finfish and livestock, and now it is being applied to shellfish.\n\nThe use of genomic selection in oysters is improving survival rates in low-salinity environments, a crucial trait given the increasing frequency of extreme weather events that introduce large freshwater inputs into coastal farming areas.\nMarker-assisted selection (MAS) is being employed to accelerate breeding for traits like shell strength, which is vital for both consumer preference and post-harvest handling.\nResearchers are also exploring CRISPR and other gene-editing technologies to validate gene function, though regulatory challenges remain.\n\n\nOvercoming Challenges: From Research to Industry Application\n\nDespite these advancements, challenges remain in translating genomic discoveries into tangible benefits for shellfish farmers.\n\nCost & Accessibility: While sequencing costs are declining, implementing genomic selection on a commercial scale still requires investment in infrastructure, training, and data management.\nRegulatory Landscape: The potential application of gene-editing technologies in aquaculture is still subject to regulatory scrutiny. While some countries are moving toward acceptance, others remain cautious.\nData Integration: The vast amount of genomic and phenotypic data generated requires sophisticated bioinformatics tools for analysis. Efforts like AquaMine (a genomic database for aquaculture species) are helping streamline this process ￼."

    "text": "Abstract\nThe fish’s immune response is affected by different factors, including a wide range of environmental conditions that can also disrupt or promote changes in the host- pathogen interactions. How environmental conditions modulate the salmon genome during parasitism is poorly understood here. This study aimed to explore the environmental influence on the Salmo salar transcriptome and methylome infected with the sea louse Caligus rogercresseyi. Atlantic salmon were experimentally infected with lice at two temperatures (8 and 16oC) and salinity conditions (32 and 26PSU). Fish tissues were collected from the infected Atlantic salmon for reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) and whole transcriptome sequencing (RNAseq) analysis. The parasitic load was highly divergent in the evaluated environmental conditions, where the lowest lice abundance was observed in fish infected at 8oC/26PSU. Notably, transcriptome profile differences were statistically associated with the number of alternative splicing events in fish exposed to low temperature/salinity conditions. Furthermore, the temperature significantly affected the methylation level, where high values of differential methylation regions were observed at 16oC. Also, the association between expression levels of spliced transcripts and their methylation levels was determined, revealing significant correlations with Ferroptosis and TLR KEEG pathways. This study supports the relevance of the environmental conditions during host-parasite interactions in marine ecosystems. The discovery of alternative splicing transcripts associated with DMRs is also discussed as a novel player in fish biology."

    "text": "Abstract\nBackground Microbial communities are ubiquitous throughout ecosystems and are commensal with hosts across taxonomic boundaries. Environmental and species-specific microbiomes are instrumental in maintaining ecosystem and host health, respectively. The introduction of pathogenic microbes that shift microbiome community structure can lead to illness and death. Understanding the dynamics of microbiomes across a diversity of environments and hosts will help us to better understand which taxa forecast survival and which forecast mortality events. Results We characterized the bacterial community microbiome in the water of a commercial shellfish hatchery in Washington state, USA, where the hatchery has been plagued by recurring and unexplained larval mortality events. By applying the complementary methods of metagenomics and metaproteomics we were able to more fully characterize the bacterial taxa in the hatchery at high (pH 8.2) and low (pH 7.1) pH that were metabolically active versus present but not contributing metabolically. There were shifts in the taxonomy and functional profile of the microbiome between pH and over time. Based on detected metagenomic reads and metaproteomic peptide spectral matches, some taxa were more metabolically active than expected based on presence alone (Deltaproteobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria) and some were less metabolically active than expected (e.g., Betaproteobacteria, Cytophagia). There was little correlation between potential and realized metabolic function based on Gene Ontology analysis of detected genes and peptides. Conclusion The complementary methods of metagenomics and metaproteomics contribute to a more full characterization of bacterial taxa that are potentially active versus truly metabolically active and thus impact water quality and inter-trophic relationships."

    "text": "Abstract\nPacific oysters (Crassostrea gigas) are a valuable aquaculture product that provides important ecosystem benefits. Among other threats, climate-driven changes in ocean temperature can impact oyster metabolism, survivorship, and immune function. We investigated how elevated temperature impacts larval oysters during settlement (19–33 days post-fertilization), using shotgun proteomics with data-independent acquisition to identify proteins present in the oysters after 2 weeks of exposure to 23 °C or 29 °C. Oysters maintained at elevated temperatures were larger and had a higher settlement rate, with 86% surviving to the end of the experiment; these oysters also had higher abundance trends of proteins related to metabolism and growth. Oysters held at 23 °C were smaller, had a decreased settlement rate, displayed 100% mortality, and had elevated abundance trends of proteins related to immune response. This novel use of proteomics was able to capture characteristic shifts in protein abundance that hint at important differences in the phenotypic response of Pacific oysters to temperature regimes. Additionally, this work has produced a robust proteomic product that will be the basis for future research on bivalve developmental processes."

    "text": "Abstract\nThere is a growing focus on the role of DNA methylation in the ability of marine invertebrates to rapidly respond to changing environmental factors and anthropogenic impacts. However, genome-wide DNA methylation studies in nonmodel organisms are currently hampered by a limited understanding of methodological biases. Here, we compare three methods for quantifying DNA methylation at single base-pair resolution—whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS), reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS), and methyl-CpG binding domain bisulfite sequencing (MBDBS)—using multiple individuals from two reef-building coral species with contrasting environmental sensitivity. All methods reveal substantially greater methylation in Montipora capitata (11.4%) than the more sensitive Pocillopora acuta (2.9%). The majority of CpG methylation in both species occurs in gene bodies and flanking regions. In both species, MBDBS has the greatest capacity for detecting CpGs in coding regions at our sequencing depth, but MBDBS may be influenced by intrasample methylation heterogeneity. RRBS yields robust information for specific loci albeit without enrichment of any particular genome feature and with significantly reduced genome coverage. Relative genome size strongly influences the number and location of CpGs detected by each method when sequencing depth is limited, illuminating nuances in cross-species comparisons. As genome-wide methylation differences, supported by data across bisulfite sequencing methods, may contribute to environmental sensitivity phenotypes in critical marine invertebrate taxa, these data provide a genomic resource for investigating the functional role of DNA methylation in environmental tolerance."

    "text": "Abstract\nPolyploidy has been shown to negatively impact environmental stress tolerance, resulting in increased susceptibility to extreme climate events such as marine heatwaves (MHWs). In this study, we used the response of the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas to MHWs as a model system to identify key ploidy-specific differences in the physiological and transcriptomic response of oysters to environmental stress. In this study, adult diploid (2n) and triploid (3n) oysters were exposed to elevated seawater temperature (single stressor; 30°C), elevated temperature followed by acute desiccation stress (multiple stressor; 30°C + emersion at an aerial temperature of 44°C for 4h), or a control (17°C) within a hatchery setting. Oyster mortality rate was elevated within stress treatments with respect to the control and was significantly higher in triploids than diploids following multiple stress exposure (36.4% vs. 14.8%). Triploids within the multiple stressor treatment exhibited signs of energetic limitation, including metabolic depression, a significant reduction in ctenidium Na+/K+ ATPase activity, and the dysregulated expression of key genes associated with heat tolerance, the inhibition of apoptosis, and mitochondrial function. Functional enrichment analysis of ploidy-specific gene sets identified that biological processes associated with metabolism, stress tolerance, and immune function were overrepresented within triploids across stress treatments. Our results demonstrate that triploidy impacts the transcriptional regulation of key metabolic processes that underly the environmental stress response of Pacific oysters, resulting in downstream shifts in physiological tolerance limits that may be detrimental to survival. The impact of chromosome set manipulation on the climate resilience of marine populations has important implications for the adaptability of marine populations and domestic food security within future climate scenarios, especially as triploidy induction becomes an increasingly popular tool to elicit reproductive control across a wide range of marine organisms used within marine aquaculture."

    "text": "Abstract\nFor ectothermic marine invertebrates living in temperate regions, impacts of ocean warming will vary considerably by season. In many species, reproductive and metabolic processes are tightly linked to the seasonal change from winter to spring, yet we know little about how these processes will shift as winters become milder. This study examined latent effects of winter warming on spring reproduction in the Olympia oyster, Ostrea lurida. Adults were collected in autumn from central Puget Sound, WA, USA, and exposed to two winter temperatures (7 °C, 10 °C) in the presence of food limited (5 k algal cells/mL) and food abundant (50 k algal cells/mL) environments. Following treatments, adults exposed to elevated winter temperature contained larger oocytes regardless of feeding regime, and those also fed abundant food contained more developed sperm. Adults then spawned in common conditions, and larvae were reared through settlement to assess carryover effects of winter treatments on larval viability. Adults previously exposed to elevated winter temperature (10 °C) produced larger larvae, particularly if they were also fed high food levels. More developed gametes and larger larvae suggest that gametogenesis occurred at low levels throughout the winter, possibly resulting in increased maternal provisioning to influence larval size. Interestingly, winter temperature did not impact larval survival, or the timing or magnitude of larval production. In the wild, more developed gametes and larger larvae following milder winters could greatly impact recruitment patterns, possibly benefitting O. lurida populations. In the hatchery setting, larval production and survival is not contingent upon winter conditions, and larval survival does not correlate with oocyte and larval size. Our results suggest that O. lurida reproduction is resilient to winter warming. Furthermore, as global temperature continues to rise, winter conditions should not be overlooked when examining reproduction in O. lurida and other temperate marine invertebrates with similar reproductive cycles."

    "text": "Abstract\nClimate change accelerates coral reef decline and jeopardizes recruitment essential for ecosystem recovery. Adult corals rely on a vital nutritional exchange with their symbiotic algae (Symbiodiniaceae), but the dynamics of reliance from fertilization to recruitment are understudied. We investigated the physiological, metabolomic, and transcriptomic changes across 13 developmental stages of Montipora capitata, a coral in Hawaiʻi that inherits symbionts from parent to egg. We found that embryonic development depends on maternally provisioned mRNAs and lipids, with a rapid shift to symbiont-derived nutrition in late developmental stages. Symbiont density and photosynthesis peak in swimming larvae to fuel pelagic dispersal. By contrast, respiratory demand increases significantly during metamorphosis and settlement, reflecting this energy-intensive morphological reorganization. Symbiont proliferation is driven by symbiont ammonium assimilation in larval stages with little evidence of nitrogen metabolism in the coral host. As development progresses, the host enhances nitrogen sequestration, regulating symbiont populations, and ensuring the transfer of fixed carbon to support metamorphosis, with both metabolomic and transcriptomic indicators of increased carbohydrate availability. Although algal symbiont community composition remained stable, bacterial communities shifted with ontogeny, associated with holobiont metabolic reorganization. Our study reveals extensive metabolic changes during development with increasing reliance on symbiont nutrition. Metamorphosis and settlement emerge as critical periods of energetic vulnerability to projected climate scenarios that destabilize symbiosis. This highly detailed characterization of symbiotic nutritional exchange during sensitive early life stages provides essential knowledge for understanding and forecasting the function of nutritional symbioses and, specifically, coral survival and recruitment in a future of climate change."

    "text": "Abstract\n\nBackground\nThe innovations of the “Omics Era” have ushered in significant advancements in genetic improvement of agriculturally important animal species through transforming genetics, genomics and breeding strategies. These advancements were often coordinated, in part, by support provided over 30 years through the 1993–2023 National Research Support Project 8 (NRSP8, National Animal Genome Research Program, NAGRP) and affiliate projects focused on enabling genomic discoveries in livestock, poultry, and aquaculture species. These significant and parallel advances demand strategic planning of future research priorities. This paper, as an output from the May 2023 Aquaculture Genomics, Genetics, and Breeding Workshop, provides an updated status of genomic resources for United States aquaculture species, highlighting major achievements and emerging priorities.\n\n\nMain text\nFinfish and shellfish genome and omics resources enhance our understanding of genetic architecture and heritability of performance and production traits. The 2023 Workshop identified present aims for aquaculture genomics/omics research to build on this progress: (1) advancing reference genome assembly quality; (2) integrating multi-omics data to enhance analysis of production and performance traits; (3) developing resources for the collection and integration of phenomics data; (4) creating pathways for applying and integrating genomics information across animal industries; and (5) providing training, extension, and outreach to support the application of genome to phenome. Research focuses should emphasize phenomics data collection, artificial intelligence, identifying causative relationships between genotypes and phenotypes, establishing pathways to apply genomic information and tools across aquaculture industries, and an expansion of training programs for the next-generation workforce to facilitate integration of genomic sciences into aquaculture operations to enhance productivity, competitiveness, and sustainability.\n\n\nConclusion\nThis collective vision of applying genomics to aquaculture breeding with focus on the highlighted priorities is intended to facilitate the continued advancement of the United States aquaculture genomics, genetics and breeding research community and industries. Critical challenges ahead include the practical application of genomic tools and analytical frameworks beyond academic and research communities that require collaborative partnerships between academia, government, and industry. The scope of this review encompasses the use of omics tools and applications in the study of aquatic animals cultivated for human consumption in aquaculture settings throughout their life-cycle."

    "text": "Abstract\n\nGenomic methods are becoming increasingly valuable and established in eco- logical research, particularly in nonmodel species. Supporting their progress and adoption requires investment in resources that promote (i) reproducibility of genomic analyses, (ii) accessibility of learning tools and (iii) keeping pace with rapidly developing methods and principles.\nWe introduce marineomics.io, an open-source, living document to disseminate tutorials, reproducibility tools and best principles for ecological genomic research in marine and nonmodel systems.\nThe website’s existing content spans population and functional genomics, includ- ing current recommendations for whole-genome sequencing, RAD-seq, Pool-seq and RNA-seq. With the goal to facilitate the development of new, similar re- sources, we describe our process for aggregating and synthesizing methodologi- cal principles from the ecological genomics community to inform website content. We also detail steps for authorship and submission of new website content, as well as protocols for providing feedback and topic requests from the community.\nThese web resources were constructed with guidance for doing rigorous, repro- ducible science. Collaboration and contributions to the website are encouraged from scientists of all skill sets and levels of expertise."

    "text": "Abstract\nFor marine invertebrates with a pelagic–benthic life cycle, larval exposure to ocean acidification (OA) can affect adult performance in response to another environmental stressor. This carry-over effect has the potential to alter phenotypic traits. However, the molecular mechanisms that mediate “OA”-triggered carry-over effects have not been explored despite such information being key to improving species fitness and management strategies for aquafarming. This study integrated the genome-wide DNA methylome and transcriptome to examine epigenetic modification-mediated carry-over OA impacts on phenotypic traits of the ecologically and commercially important oyster species Crassostrea hongkongensis under field conditions. Larvae of C. hongkongensis were exposed to control pH 8.0 and low pH 7.4 conditions, mimicking near future OA scenario in their habitat, before being outplanted as post-metamorphic juveniles at two mariculture field sites with contrasting environmental stressors for 9 months. The larval carry-over OA effect was found to have persistent impacts on the growth and survival trade-off traits on the outplanted juveniles, although the beneficial or adverse effect depended on the environmental conditions at the outplanted sites. Site-specific plasticity was demonstrated with a diverse DNA methylation-associated gene expression profile, with signal transduction and the endocrine system being the most common and highly enriched functions. Highly methylated exons prevailed in the key genes related to general metabolic and endocytic responses and these genes are evolutionarily conserved in various marine invertebrates in response to OA. These results suggest that oysters with prior larval exposure history to OA had the ability to trigger rapid local adaptive responses via epigenetic modification to cope with multiple stressors in the field."

    "text": "Abstract\nOcean acidification significantly affects marine calcifiers like oysters, warranting the study of molecular mechanisms like DNA methylation that contribute to adaptive plasticity in response to environmental change. However, a consensus has not been reached on the extent to which methylation modules gene expression, and in turn plasticity, in marine invertebrates. In this study, we investigated the impact of pCO2 on gene expression and DNA methylation in the eastern oyster, Crassostrea virginica. After a 30-day exposure to control (572 ppm) or elevated pCO2 (2,827 ppm), whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) and RNA-Seq data were generated from adult female gonad tissue and male sperm samples. Although differentially methylated loci (DML) were identified in females (89) and males (2,916), there were no differentially expressed genes, and only one differentially expressed transcript in females. However, gene body methylation impacted other forms of gene activity in sperm, such as the maximum number of transcripts expressed per gene and changes in the predominant transcript expressed. Elevated pCO2 exposure increased gene expression variability (transcriptional noise) in males but decreased noise in females, suggesting a sex-specific role of methylation in gene expression regulation. Functional annotation of genes with changes in transcript-level expression or containing DML revealed several enriched biological processes potentially involved in elevated pCO2 response, including apoptotic pathways and signal transduction, as well as reproductive functions. Taken together, these results suggest that DNA methylation may regulate gene expression variability to maintain homeostasis in elevated pCO2 conditions and could play a key role in environmental resilience in marine invertebrates."

    "text": "Abstract\nThe marine shellfish aquaculture industry across the U.S. Pacific region faces escalating ocean acidification and its associated challenges. This study examines industry participant perceptions and experiences regarding ocean acidification, additional threats, and future research needs, finding a notable decrease in perceived concern regarding ocean acidification over the past decade. Through structured interviews, broad industry perspectives are explored regarding current practices and two specific ocean acidification adaptation strategies under development: parental priming and native species portfolio expansion. While parental priming garnered cautious support contingent on scientific validation, perceptions of native species expansion were polarized, driven by skepticism about regulatory barriers, economic viability, and scalability. Enhanced environmental monitoring emerged as the most widely supported adaptation measure, underscoring its importance in addressing multiple stressors in addition to ocean acidification. By considering industry and operation characteristics while examining potential decision-making biases, this study provides unique insights for co-producing relevant adaptation strategies. Additionally, the critical role of collaboration between stakeholders, researchers, and policymakers in fostering resilience is emphasized."

    "text": "Abstract\nSince the introduction of the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas in Baja California Sur, Mexico, its culture has faced environmental challenges, specifically increasing temperatures that result in high mortalities. The inter-tidal zone seawater temperature during a year at the Baja California Peninsula broadly ranges from 7 °C to 39 °C. Therefore, to understand how oysters respond to heat stress during daily temperature oscillations, heat-resistant (RR, father, and mother resistant) and heat-susceptible (SS, both parents susceptible) phenotypes families from a C. gigas breeding program were exposed to a thermal challenge. Based on a laboratory-simulated daily oscillatory thermal challenge (26 to 34 °C) for 30 days, RR phenotype presented differences compared to SS phenotype since the beginning (day 0) of the thermal challenge. Gene expression analyses revealed 1822 differentially expressed up-regulated transcripts in RR, related to functions of metabolic processes, biological regulation, and response to stimulus and signaling. At the end of the experiment (day 30), 2660 differentially expressed up-regulated transcripts were identified in RR. Functional analysis of the genes expressed indicates responses of regulation of biological processes and response to a stimulus. Additionally, 340 genes were differentially expressed among RR vs. SS from the beginning to the end of the thermal challenge, where 170 genes were up-regulated, and 170 were down-regulated. These transcriptomic profiles represent the first report to identify gene expression markers associated with RR phenotypes for the Pacific oyster to the future broodstock selection.\n\n\n\nga"

    "text": "Laura M. Parker, Elliot Scanes, Wayne A. O’Connor, Michael Dove, Thiyagarajan Vengatesen, Steven Roberts, Pauline M. Ross. Transgenerational plasticity responses differ across genetically distinct families in the Sydney rock oyster, Saccostrea glomerata. Marine Environmental Research, 2025, 107540. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.marenvres.2025.107540 ## Abstract\n\nAcross the globe, marine organisms need to rapidly respond to climate change. Acclimation through the mechanism of transgenerational plasticity (TGP) is now at the forefront of research, providing hope that some marine organisms may persist into the future. To date, however, because most studies have focussed on the average phenotypic species response to climate change, we do not know whether phenotypic responses vary among genotypes. Here, we take a next critical step in TGP research to assess whether TGP responses to ocean acidification (OA) differ among genotypes of the culturally significant and iconic Sydney Rock Oyster (SRO), Saccostrea glomerata. Adults of four genetically distinct families of the SRO were exposed to ambient (410 μatm) and elevated (1000 μatm) pCO2 for 9 weeks during reproductive conditioning. Following this exposure, we performed a within family cross of each family and measured the percentage development, abnormality, shell length and respiration rate of D-veliger larvae after 48 hours in the same ambient and elevated pCO2 treatments. We found significant variability in TGP responses among families to elevated pCO2, with positive, negative, and neutral responses in larval offspring. How well we understand the adaptive potential of oysters and their capacity to mount fast responses through TGP to climate change will determine our ability to ensure the sustainability of SRO populations, marine food security and the cultural heritage of this iconic species. Combined approaches quantifying both genetic and non-genetic TGP responses are needed to determine the total adaptive potential of other marine organisms to climate change."

    "text": "Laura M. Parker, Elliot Scanes, Wayne A. O’Connor, Michael Dove, Thiyagarajan Vengatesen, Steven Roberts, Pauline M. Ross. Transgenerational plasticity responses differ across genetically distinct families in the Sydney rock oyster, Saccostrea glomerata. Marine Environmental Research, 2025, 107540. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.marenvres.2025.107540 ## Abstract\n\nAcross the globe, marine organisms need to rapidly respond to climate change. Acclimation through the mechanism of transgenerational plasticity (TGP) is now at the forefront of research, providing hope that some marine organisms may persist into the future. To date, however, because most studies have focussed on the average phenotypic species response to climate change, we do not know whether phenotypic responses vary among genotypes. Here, we take a next critical step in TGP research to assess whether TGP responses to ocean acidification (OA) differ among genotypes of the culturally significant and iconic Sydney Rock Oyster (SRO), Saccostrea glomerata. Adults of four genetically distinct families of the SRO were exposed to ambient (410 μatm) and elevated (1000 μatm) pCO2 for 9 weeks during reproductive conditioning. Following this exposure, we performed a within family cross of each family and measured the percentage development, abnormality, shell length and respiration rate of D-veliger larvae after 48 hours in the same ambient and elevated pCO2 treatments. We found significant variability in TGP responses among families to elevated pCO2, with positive, negative, and neutral responses in larval offspring. How well we understand the adaptive potential of oysters and their capacity to mount fast responses through TGP to climate change will determine our ability to ensure the sustainability of SRO populations, marine food security and the cultural heritage of this iconic species. Combined approaches quantifying both genetic and non-genetic TGP responses are needed to determine the total adaptive potential of other marine organisms to climate change."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nTanner crab (Chionoecetes bairdi) is an economically important species that is threatened by ocean warming and bitter crab disease, which is caused by an endoparasitic dinoflagellate, Hematodinium. Little is known about disease transmission or its link to host mortality, or how ocean warming will affect pathogenicity or host susceptibility. To provide a transcriptomic resource for the Tanner crab, we generated a suite of RNA-seq libraries encompassing pooled hemolymph samples from crab displaying differing infection statuses and maintained at different temperatures (ambient (7.5˚C), elevated (10˚C), or decreased (4˚C)). After assembling a transcriptome and performing a multifactor differential gene expression analysis, we found genes influenced by temperature in relation to infection and detected some of those genes over time at the individual level using RNA-seq data from one crab. Biological processes associated with those genes include lipid storage, transcription, response to oxidative stress, cell adhesion, and morphogenesis. Alteration in lipid storage and transcription provide insight into how temperature impacts energy allocation in Hematodinium infected crabs. Alteration in expression patterns in genes associated with morphogenesis could suggest that hemocytes were changing morphology and/or type in response to temperature. This project provides insight into how Hematodinium infection could influence crab physiology as oceans warm."

Contacting your TA’s and/or professors is a great way to connect with research groups on campus. You could talk to your TA or professor in person during your classes, or you can use the email template we created below to reach out. They may be looking for undergraduate research assistants, or they may be able to introduce you to labs in your field(s) of interest.\nEngage with department/university programming related to undergraduate research. For example, UW hosts an annual Undergraduate Research Symposium, where students present their work. This could be an excellent opportunity to see what kind of work is available to undergrads and to connect with labs of interest.\n\nDirectly emailing the lab you are interested in working with is a great way to reach out to lab groups. You can find the email addresses of professors, postdocs, and graduate students on the university department websites.\nWho do you send an email to?\n\nPrincipal Investigators (PI) and professors\nPostdocs/Research staff\nGraduate students\n\nLook for the professor’s web page on the university departments websites. Each professor’s contact information will have a page with their research areas and links to further information including lab websites. The lab websites are a great place to learn about the lab’s research and some labs will post information on available undergraduate research opportunities. Here are some examples of contact information for the School of Aquatic and Fisheries Sciences:\n\nSAFS Faculty\n\nSAFS postdocs\n\nSAFS research staff\n\nWrite a concise email!\nYour email to a prospective lab should be short and to the point and contain the information required for the lab to understand how your interests align with the current projects.\nWe have developed a template email (see below) for you that you can use to help write your emails to prospective labs!\nHere are the things to include in your email:\n\nAddress the correct person and ensure you state their name correctly.

Labs vary in flexibility, workload, and expectations, so be open to diverse tasks, even if they aren’t your ideal project, as they help build skills and explore interests. Science often involves repetitive tasks, and research experience is more about skill development than a specific topic. You don’t always need prior experience, and labs may say no—but keep trying, seek new opportunities, and ask for recommendations. Prioritize coursework, know your boundaries, and don’t hesitate to decline opportunities that don’t align with your goals.

    "text": "The fun part - doing research!\nConducting research is a valuable and exciting experience. Here are some things to consider as you begin your research experience:\nMeet lab expectations and safety/documentation requirements:\n\nMay include trainings and onboarding protocols\nMary Gates Research Resource\nCollege of the Environment resources\nConsider lab culture and group norm expectations\n\nFollow best practices:\nStarting research in a biology lab can be exciting and a bit overwhelming, but following a few best practices will help you succeed. Good research begins with curiosity and clear questions—before running an experiment, take time to understand the scientific background and the goals of the study. When designing experiments, think carefully about your controls, variables, and sample size to ensure your results will be reliable and meaningful. In the lab, stay organized, label everything clearly, and keep detailed notes in your lab notebook—good records are essential for tracking progress and troubleshooting. If you’re doing molecular work, precision and cleanliness are key: always follow protocols carefully, use sterile techniques to avoid contamination, and double-check your steps before moving forward. If you’re involved in fieldwork, planning and flexibility are equally important—prepare for the unexpected, record environmental conditions, and handle samples carefully to preserve their quality. Whether in the lab or the field, follow safety protocols, respect shared spaces and equipment, and don’t be afraid to ask questions or seek feedback. Finally, approach research with honesty, patience, and a willingness to learn—good science thrives on integrity, collaboration, and curiosity.\nScientific writing :\nWriting your first scientific paper can feel intimidating, but it’s really just a way of telling the story of your research in a clear, logical, and honest way. Start by understanding the standard structure—Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion—and how each section serves a different purpose. The Introduction sets the stage: explain what’s already known, what question you asked, and why it matters. In the Methods, describe what you did in enough detail that someone else could repeat your experiment. The Results section presents your data without interpretation—use clear figures or tables, and keep it focused. The Discussion is where you interpret your findings, compare them to other studies, and suggest what they might mean or what could be done next. Start drafting even if you don’t feel ready—it’s easier to revise a rough draft than a blank page. Ask your mentor or lab mates for examples of past student papers to see how others have structured their work. And remember, writing is a process: give yourself time to revise, get feedback, and learn as you go. The most important thing is to communicate your work clearly and honestly—science writing is about sharing knowledge, not sounding fancy.\nHere are a few resources that might be helpful:\n\nUniversity of Wisconson - Madison writing guide\n\nWriting guide from Fish 270: Aquatic Ecophysiology",

During that time, I completed my undergraduate capstone project analyzing the effects of bifenthrin exposure on the behavior of the federally endangered Delta Smelt. After graduating with a bachelor of science in Animal Biology in 2020, I continued my research work in that same lab for an additional two years and further explored the developmental, behavioral, and reproductive impacts several commonly employed urban and agricultural pyrethroids had on native Californian estuarine fish species. In 2022, I dually joined the Gardell Lab at the University of Washington, Tacoma and the Roberts Lab housed in the School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences (SAFS) at the University of Washington, Seattle. As a graduate student at SAFS, I am now focused on identifying the constraints on in vitro cellular immortality in the marine model invertebrate, Botryllus schlosseri. This exploratory process will primarily involve the implementation of procedures for systematic primary cell culture optimization, stress-induced mutagenesis, and bioinformatic network analysis.

I graduated from UW’s Marine Biology B.S. program in 2021, and went on to explore the aquatic sciences world outside of academia and research for a bit. Most of that time was spent working in education and non-profit spheres with Friends of the Issaquah Salmon Hatchery (FISH) where I was able to experience how the latest science and research is communicated to the public and advocated for with local, state, and federal legislators. In the background of this, I was also working on a manuscript for a project on invasive lionfish ecology that I started towards the end of my undergraduate career, so research was still heavily on my mind and I knew it was time to get back to it. I have been deeply fascinated in reproductive physiology and stress responses ever since I was first introduced to the topics, so the Roberts Lab seemed like the place to be. I am looking forward to my time with this group and getting to explore questions relating to stress and reproduction in the context of the ever changing climate of today’s world. Outside of school and research, I spend most of my time on a board (snow/surf/skate), in dance halls, or climbing.",

My research investigates the formation of symbiosis between corals and their algal symbionts during early development in coral species in Hawaii, USA, and Moorea, French Polynesia by utilizing physiological, metabolomic, and transcriptomic approaches. Our work also investigates the capacity for aquaculture species (e.g., the Pacific oysters) to increase thermal tolerance and growth through stress hardening.
