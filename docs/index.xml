  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>At EPIMAR2025 in Barcelona, a gathering of global marine scientists illuminated the hidden world of epigenetic regulation in marine invertebrates. These tiny organisms, often overlooked in genomic studies, are now at the forefront of revealing how life beneath the waves adapts, survives, and thrives in rapidly changing oceans.</p>
<p>In this post, we highlight key presentations that explored how DNA methylation, RNA modifications, and chromatin remodeling influence invertebrate development, stress response, and even intergenerational adaptation.</p>
<hr>
<section id="mussels-and-methylation-maps" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="mussels-and-methylation-maps">Mussels and Methylation Maps</h3>
<p><strong>Enrico D’Aniello</strong>&nbsp;and colleagues presented the first high-resolution DNA methylation map in the mussel&nbsp;<em>Mytilus galloprovincialis</em>. This map revealed key regulatory elements and tissue-specific methylation patterns, providing a baseline for understanding how gene expression is modulated in response to environmental shifts.</p>
<hr>
</section>
<section id="modifications-in-oysters" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="modifications-in-oysters">Modifications in Oysters</h3>
<p>In&nbsp;<em>Crassostrea gigas</em>,&nbsp;<strong>Natacha Clairet</strong>&nbsp;demonstrated that m6A RNA methylation plays a pivotal role in neural development and transcript splicing. Her work showed that these epitranscriptomic changes are not only developmentally regulated but may also mediate environmental responses.</p>
<p>Building on the oyster story,&nbsp;<strong>Guillaume Rivière</strong>&nbsp;showed that thermal stress leaves lasting epigenetic marks on oyster gill tissues. This “epigenetic memory” alters gene expression patterns in subsequent exposures, pointing to methylation as a resilience mechanism.</p>
<p>Meanwhile,&nbsp;<strong>Sophie Valk</strong>&nbsp;examined oysters undergoing natural sex transitions, finding unique DNA methylation signatures in hermaphrodites. Her work hints at epigenetic regulation as a driver of reproductive plasticity.</p>
<p><strong>Elyna Bouchereau</strong> from the University of Perpignan explored the methylome of <em>Vibrio aestuarianus</em>, a bacterial pathogen of oysters, revealing how epigenetic signatures may influence virulence and host interaction, while <strong>Amélie Dellong</strong> presented a multi-omics approach to decipher chromatin structure in <em>Magallana gigas</em>, offering new insight into the regulatory architecture of oyster genomes.</p>
<p><strong>Marta Pascual</strong> presented a population epigenomics study of <em>Crassostrea gigas</em> along the Iberian Atlantic coast, showing that DNA methylation patterns vary significantly between wild and farmed populations, suggesting a potential role in local adaptation and domestication.</p>
<p><strong>Lénaig Boulard</strong> investigated the epigenetic responses of Pacific oysters to ocean acidification, demonstrating methylation changes in genes associated with shell formation and oxidative stress defense.</p>
<p><strong>Céline Cosseau</strong> explored transgenerational epigenetic inheritance in oysters, showing that environmental exposures in adult oysters can lead to stable methylation changes in offspring, particularly in stress-response genes.</p>
<hr>
</section>
<section id="corals-and-the-code-of-light" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="corals-and-the-code-of-light">Corals and the Code of Light</h3>
<p>Reef-building corals were another highlight.&nbsp;<strong>Kathleen Durkin</strong>&nbsp;described how miRNAs and lncRNAs shape coral development and immunity under heat stress.&nbsp;<strong>Kelly Gómez-Campo</strong>&nbsp;added that light exposure during development can modulate DNA methylation patterns and downstream gene networks in corals, underscoring how tightly environment and epigenome are interlinked.<br>
<strong>Hollie Putnam</strong> presented a comprehensive study on the spatial and temporal dynamics of epigenetic regulation in reef-building corals, while <strong>Jill Ashey</strong> highlighted the critical roles of non-coding RNAs during early coral development, particularly in mediating the maternal-to-zygotic transition.</p>
<hr>
</section>
<section id="histone-modifications-in-sea-anemones" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="histone-modifications-in-sea-anemones">Histone Modifications in Sea Anemones</h3>
<p>In the heat-stressed sea anemone&nbsp;<em>Exaiptasia diaphana</em>,&nbsp;<strong>Mascha Dix</strong>&nbsp;presented findings on histone modifications (H3K27me3 and H3K4me3) as key players in regulating gene expression. These modifications allow rapid but reversible responses to changing thermal conditions.</p>
<hr>
</section>
<section id="hypoxia-and-neural-epigenetics-in-sea-hares" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="hypoxia-and-neural-epigenetics-in-sea-hares">Hypoxia and Neural Epigenetics in Sea Hares</h3>
<p><strong>Javier Rodriguez-Casariego</strong>&nbsp;studied the sea hare&nbsp;<em>Aplysia californica</em>&nbsp;and showed that DNA methylation shifts in neural tissues under hypoxic conditions suggest a role for epigenetic plasticity in environmental stress tolerance.</p>
<hr>
</section>
<section id="conclusion-epigenetics-as-a-unifying-language" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion-epigenetics-as-a-unifying-language">Conclusion: Epigenetics as a Unifying Language</h3>
<p>These studies collectively show that epigenetic mechanisms are not just molecular curiosities—they are central to how marine invertebrates sense, remember, and adapt to their environment. Whether through methylation, non-coding RNA, or histone marks, the language of the epigenome is being translated into actionable insights for conservation, aquaculture, and understanding evolution under climate change.</p>
<p>EPIMAR2025 made one thing clear: the future of marine biology will be written in epigenetic code.</p>

  <title>Environmental Priming in Practice</title>
  <dc:creator>Steven Roberts</dc:creator>
  <link>https://faculty.washington.edu/sr320/posts/frontpage/sr320-lewis-smith/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>We're proud to share a new publication by former lab member <strong>Connor Lewis-Smith</strong>, now a Social Scientist with NOAA's Northwest Fisheries Science Center. His article, <em>"Navigating ocean acidification in shellfish aquaculture: Stakeholder perspectives of developing strategies in the U.S. Pacific Region"</em>, was just released in <em>Aquaculture Reports</em> and offers an in-depth look at how shellfish growers across the U.S. Pacific Coast are responding to ocean acidification and related environmental stressors.</p>
<p>The study draws on structured interviews with producers from Washington, Oregon, California, Alaska, and Hawaii to capture evolving perceptions of ocean acidification and industry interest in emerging adaptation strategies. Notably, concern about ocean acidification appears to have declined in the past decade, as growers increasingly focus on intersecting threats such as harmful algal blooms, disease, and rising temperatures.</p>
<p>The paper explores two adaptation strategies under development: <strong>parental priming</strong>—a technique involving exposure of broodstock to stressful conditions to enhance offspring resilience—and <strong>native species portfolio expansion</strong>. While industry support for both strategies was mixed and often contingent on further scientific validation, the study emphasizes the importance of early engagement between researchers and growers to co-develop viable solutions.</p>
<p>Importantly, this research aligns directly with <strong>ongoing environmental priming work in our lab</strong>, where we are experimentally testing how exposure to low pH and high temperature conditions in adult shellfish can influence offspring performance. By integrating physiological, transcriptomic, and lipidomic data, our current NOAA-funded work seeks to identify the mechanisms underlying carryover effects and inform hatchery practices that enhance larval resilience under future ocean conditions.</p>
<p>Connor's collaboration with our group helped build the interdisciplinary foundation for this kind of applied science—where social, biological, and ecological factors intersect to shape adaptation in real-world settings. We're excited to see how his work complements and extends our efforts to support a more resilient shellfish aquaculture sector.</p>

  <title>Exploring the Non-Coding RNA Landscape in Reef-Building Corals</title>
  <link>https://faculty.washington.edu/sr320/posts/frontpage/sr320-lncRNA-rep/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Coral reefs are among the most biodiverse ecosystems on the planet, yet they are increasingly threatened by climate change and human activities. Understanding the molecular mechanisms that govern coral resilience is crucial for their conservation. A <a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.03.15.643469.">new study by Ashey et al.&nbsp;(2025)</a> provides a groundbreaking look into the non-coding RNA (ncRNA) repertoire of reef-building corals, shedding light on how these regulatory molecules contribute to coral gene expression and environmental adaptability.</p>
<section id="why-non-coding-rnas-matter" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-non-coding-rnas-matter"><strong>Why Non-Coding RNAs Matter</strong></h3>
<p>Long dismissed as “junk” DNA, ncRNAs have emerged as vital regulators of gene expression across all domains of life. Unlike protein-coding genes, ncRNAs do not translate into proteins but instead play critical roles in controlling genetic pathways, chromatin organization, and stress responses. In corals, these molecules could be key players in their ability to withstand environmental stressors such as rising ocean temperatures and pollution.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-study-a-comprehensive-analysis-of-coral-ncrnas" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-study-a-comprehensive-analysis-of-coral-ncrnas"><strong>The Study: A Comprehensive Analysis of Coral ncRNAs</strong></h3>
<p>Ashey et al.&nbsp;conducted the first large-scale characterization of ncRNAs in three ecologically significant coral species from Mo’orea, French Polynesia:&nbsp;<em>Acropora pulchra</em>,&nbsp;<em>Pocillopora tuahiniensis</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Porites evermanni</em>. These species exhibit diverse physiological traits and symbiotic relationships, making them excellent models for studying ncRNA variation.</p>
<section id="key-findings" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="key-findings"><strong>Key Findings:</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Diverse ncRNA Repertoires:</strong>&nbsp;The study identified a broad array of ncRNAs, including long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), microRNAs (miRNAs), and piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), indicating that corals possess a complex ncRNA regulatory system.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Limited Conservation Across Species:</strong>&nbsp;While a few miRNAs (such as&nbsp;<em>mir-100</em>) were conserved across all three species, most lncRNAs and other ncRNAs exhibited high evolutionary turnover, suggesting species-specific adaptations.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Functional Insights:</strong>&nbsp;Many ncRNAs were associated with immune regulation, stress response, and genomic stability. For example, lncRNAs were often found near immune-related genes, while piRNAs were enriched in transposable element regions, which are crucial for maintaining genomic integrity.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>miRNA-Target Interactions:</strong>&nbsp;The study predicted miRNA targets involved in immune response pathways and cellular stress mechanisms, providing new insights into how corals regulate gene expression in response to environmental changes.</p></li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="implications-for-coral-resilience"><strong>Implications for Coral Resilience</strong></h3>
<p>These findings underscore the importance of ncRNAs in coral biology. By regulating gene expression and protecting genome stability, ncRNAs may influence corals’ ability to acclimate to shifting environmental conditions. This research also sets the stage for future studies on the role of ncRNAs in coral bleaching, symbiosis dynamics, and adaptation.</p>
</section>
<section id="future-directions" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="future-directions"><strong>Future Directions</strong></h3>
<p>Given the rapid decline of coral reefs worldwide, understanding the molecular underpinnings of coral resilience is more critical than ever.

  <title>Unlocking the Future of Shellfish Aquaculture Through Genomics</title>
  <link>https://faculty.washington.edu/sr320/posts/frontpage/sr320-genomics/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Aquaculture is undergoing a revolution. The integration of cutting-edge genomic tools into breeding programs is transforming the industry, allowing for enhanced growth rates, disease resistance, and environmental adaptability in farmed species. While finfish often take center stage in discussions about genomic innovation, shellfish—particularly oysters, clams, and other bivalves—stand to benefit tremendously from these advancements. A recent review by <a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12864-025-11247-z">Andersen et al.&nbsp;(2025), published in BMC Genomics</a>, outlines the progress and future priorities for U.S. aquaculture genomics, with significant implications for shellfish industries.</p>
<section id="why-genomics-matters-for-shellfish" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-genomics-matters-for-shellfish">Why Genomics Matters for Shellfish</h2>
<p>Shellfish farming is a cornerstone of coastal economies, providing a sustainable protein source while contributing to water filtration and habitat structure. However, challenges such as disease outbreaks, climate change-driven stressors (e.g., ocean acidification, salinity fluctuations), and genetic bottlenecks in breeding programs pose significant hurdles. The integration of genomics and multi-omics approaches is helping researchers and industry stakeholders address these issues head-on.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Advancing Reference Genomes for Shellfish</li>
</ol>
<p>One of the key priorities identified in the review is the need for high-quality genome assemblies for shellfish species. Reference genomes serve as blueprints for breeding programs, guiding selective breeding efforts toward desirable traits such as disease resistance, growth efficiency, and stress tolerance.</p>
<p>For instance:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The Pacific oyster (Magallana gigas) and Eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) now have improved genome assemblies, which are crucial for mapping genes associated with disease resilience.</p></li>
<li><p>Structural variations in oyster genomes have been linked to breeding success, helping hatcheries refine their selection of broodstock.</p></li>
<li><p>Functional annotation efforts, like those undertaken by the international FAANG (Functional Annotation of ANimal Genomes) initiative, are improving our understanding of how genes are regulated in response to environmental stressors.</p></li>
</ul>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Multi-Omics Approaches: Beyond the Genome</li>
</ol>
<p>While genomic sequencing provides a foundational understanding of shellfish biology, integrating other “omics” layers—epigenomics, transcriptomics, and microbiomics—adds depth to the picture.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Epigenomics &amp; Environmental Adaptation: Studies have shown that DNA methylation plays a key role in how oysters respond to stress, such as changes in salinity and temperature. This suggests that breeding for resilience might not just be about genetics but also about harnessing heritable epigenetic modifications.</p></li>
<li><p>Transcriptomics &amp; Disease Resistance: RNA sequencing has revealed that oysters activate specific immune pathways when exposed to pathogens like Perkinsus marinus (which causes Dermo disease). Understanding these pathways helps identify candidate genes for selective breeding.</p></li>
<li><p>Microbiomics &amp; Shellfish Health: The microbial communities living on and inside shellfish significantly impact their growth and survival. Some studies suggest that manipulating the oyster microbiome could enhance disease resistance.</p></li>
</ul>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Genomic Selection &amp; Breeding Programs</li>
</ol>
<p>Traditional shellfish breeding has relied on mass selection or family-based selection, which can be slow and inefficient. Genomic selection—where DNA markers are used to predict an individual’s breeding value—has revolutionized selective breeding in finfish and livestock, and now it is being applied to shellfish.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The use of genomic selection in oysters is improving survival rates in low-salinity environments, a crucial trait given the increasing frequency of extreme weather events that introduce large freshwater inputs into coastal farming areas.</p></li>
<li><p>Marker-assisted selection (MAS) is being employed to accelerate breeding for traits like shell strength, which is vital for both consumer preference and post-harvest handling.</p></li>
<li><p>Researchers are also exploring CRISPR and other gene-editing technologies to validate gene function, though regulatory challenges remain.</p></li>
</ul>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>Overcoming Challenges: From Research to Industry Application</li>
</ol>
<p>Despite these advancements, challenges remain in translating genomic discoveries into tangible benefits for shellfish farmers.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Cost &amp; Accessibility: While sequencing costs are declining, implementing genomic selection on a commercial scale still requires investment in infrastructure, training, and data management.</p></li>
<li><p>Regulatory Landscape: The potential application of gene-editing technologies in aquaculture is still subject to regulatory scrutiny. While some countries are moving toward acceptance, others remain cautious.</p></li>
<li><p>Data Integration: The vast amount of genomic and phenotypic data generated requires sophisticated bioinformatics tools for analysis. Efforts like AquaMine (a genomic database for aquaculture species) are helping streamline this process ￼.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="looking-ahead-the-future-of-shellfish-aquaculture" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="looking-ahead-the-future-of-shellfish-aquaculture">Looking Ahead: The Future of Shellfish Aquaculture</h2>
<p>The next decade of shellfish aquaculture will be defined by how well the industry can harness the power of genomics. As sequencing technology becomes more affordable and bioinformatics tools become more accessible, we are likely to see:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>More refined and efficient breeding programs using genomic selection.</p></li>
<li><p>Greater adoption of multi-omics approaches to understand complex traits like disease resistance and stress tolerance.</p></li>
<li><p>The potential emergence of gene-edited shellfish with enhanced resilience to climate change.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>By integrating these tools into aquaculture operations, we can ensure that shellfish farming remains a sustainable and resilient industry—one that continues to provide ecological and economic benefits to coastal communities while supporting global food security.</p>
</section>
<section id="final-thoughts" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>
<p><a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12864-025-11247-z">The review by Andersen et al.&nbsp;(2025)</a> highlights an exciting and rapidly evolving field. Shellfish may not have received as much genomic attention as salmon or tilapia in the past, but that is changing. With continued investment in research, training, and industry partnerships, shellfish aquaculture is poised to become a model for sustainable, high-tech food production in the 21st century.</p>

<p>Shellfish aquaculture is facing increasing challenges due to climate change, ocean acidification, and other environmental stressors. However, research is showing that environmental memory—the ability of organisms to retain and transmit adaptive responses to stress—may offer a promising strategy for improving resilience in aquaculture species.</p>
<p>At the 2025 Washington Sea Grant workshop, researchers and industry professionals came together to explore how environmental priming—exposing shellfish to controlled stress conditions—could be leveraged to enhance survival, growth, and performance.</p>

<p>To better understand industry perspectives, a survey of shellfish growers was conducted to gauge their views on environmental priming as an adaptation strategy. The results were enlightening:<br>
• 78% of hatchery operators indicated they would consider implementing environmental priming, though most preferred to see supporting data first.<br>
• 70% of respondents said they would be willing to pay more for primed seed, provided evidence from test plots or research-supported literature was available.</p>
<p>This feedback underscores the importance of continued scientific research to validate environmental priming techniques and demonstrate their effectiveness in real-world aquaculture operations.</p>

<p>Environmental priming involves exposing shellfish to controlled stressors—such as temperature fluctuations, salinity changes, or immune challenges—to enhance their resilience later in life. Research has shown promising results across multiple species:</p>
<p>• Olympia oysters: Parental priming increased offspring survival in field conditions.<br>
• Pacific geoduck: Early-life priming led to improved growth rates later in life.<br>
• Manila clams: Offspring from primed parents exhibited better growth and survival rates.</p>

<p>Scientists are now working to optimize environmental priming strategies across different species. Ongoing research at institutions like NOAA’s Manchester Field Station and the Jamestown S’Klallam Hatchery is exploring how priming can enhance the performance of shellfish under various stress conditions.</p>
<p>For Pacific oysters, researchers are testing multiple priming approaches, including:<br>
✅ Immune challenges<br>
✅ Temperature stress<br>
✅ Salinity shifts<br>
✅ Combination stress exposures</p>

<p>The insights from this research are critical for both hatchery operators and policymakers as they work toward sustainable shellfish aquaculture. With growing industry interest and evidence-based strategies, environmental priming may become a tool in ensuring the future resilience of shellfish populations.</p>
