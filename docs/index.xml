<p>Ocean acidification is often framed as a simple question of survival: can a species withstand lower pH, or not?</p>
<p>Juvenile snow crab (<em>Chionoecetes opilio</em>) complicate that narrative.</p>
<p>In a year-long experiment, snow crab maintained normal growth, molting, and morphology under both moderate (pH 7.8) and severe (pH 7.5) ocean acidification. For months, there were no visible signs of distress. Yet under severe acidification, mortality began to rise after about 250 days.</p>
<p>If the crabs looked fine, what changed?</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.64898/2026.02.04.703865v1">new transcriptomic study led by Laura H. Spencer</a> provides a mechanistic explanation. By examining gene expression after 8 hours and again after 88 days of exposure, the work reveals how tolerance operates — and where its limits lie.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<section id="the-early-response-turning-up-the-cellular-machinery" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-early-response-turning-up-the-cellular-machinery">The Early Response: Turning Up the Cellular Machinery</h2>
<p>At 8 hours, snow crab were already responding at the molecular level.</p>
<p>Across both moderate and severe acidification treatments, genes involved in:<br>
• mitochondrial metabolism<br>
• electron transport<br>
• protein refolding (heat shock proteins)<br>
• cuticle maintenance<br>
• immune modulation</p>
<p>were strongly activated.</p>
<p>The response was especially pronounced under severe acidification.</p>

<p>The volcano plots show a clear pattern: severe acidification triggers a broader and stronger transcriptional response than moderate acidification. Mitochondrial and protein homeostasis pathways dominate.</p>
<p>This is not a passive response. Snow crab rapidly increase energy production and activate cellular repair systems. Tolerance, in this case, appears to be an energetically expensive strategy.</p>

<section id="moderate-vs.-severe-adjustment-or-damage-control" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="moderate-vs.-severe-adjustment-or-damage-control">Moderate vs.&nbsp;Severe: Adjustment or Damage Control?</h2>
<p>The distinction between moderate and severe acidification is not simply one of degree — it is one of strategy.</p>
<p>Under moderate OA (pH 7.8), gene expression emphasized:<br>
• ion and osmotic regulation<br>
• solute transport<br>
• endocrine coordination</p>
<p>This resembles regulatory adjustment — maintaining balance through coordinated physiological control.</p>
<p>Under severe OA (pH 7.5), expression shifted toward:<br>
• DNA repair<br>
• RNA processing and splicing<br>
• heat shock proteins<br>
• oxidative stress pathways<br>
• chitin remodeling</p>
<p>This profile reflects cellular damage mitigation rather than fine-tuned regulation.</p>
<p>In other words:<br>
• Moderate OA → compensation<br>
• Severe OA → cellular defense</p>

<section id="the-quiet-period-before-mortality" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-quiet-period-before-mortality">The Quiet Period Before Mortality</h2>
<p>At 88 days — still well before survival diverged — gene expression patterns between moderate and severe treatments were already clearly different.</p>
<p>Figure 4. Differential expression at Day 88 (Spencer et al.&nbsp;2026)</p>
<p><img src="https://faculty.washington.edu/sr320/posts/frontpage/sr320-crab/images/clipboard-744714556.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Under chronic severe acidification, genes involved in:</p>
<p>• RNA processing<br>
• protein refolding<br>
• DNA repair<br>
• oxidative stress defense<br>
• acid–base regulation</p>
<p>remained elevated.</p>
<p>Physiologically, the crabs appeared normal. Molecularly, however, a sustained stress signature persisted.</p>
<p>The companion long-term experiment showed that mortality under severe acidification began after ~250 days.</p>
<p>The molecular data suggest why: chronic cellular maintenance carries an energetic cost that accumulates over time.</p>
<p>Eventually, that cost may become unsustainable — particularly during molting, a process that demands substantial energy and structural remodeling.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-molecular-early-warning-signal">A Molecular Early-Warning Signal</h2>
<p>Among the genes elevated under long-term severe acidification, one stood out: carbonic anhydrase 7 (CA7).</p>

<p><img src="https://faculty.washington.edu/sr320/posts/frontpage/sr320-crab/images/clipboard-971319492.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Carbonic anhydrases regulate acid–base balance. CA7 expression was specifically elevated under chronic severe acidification, making it a promising biomarker of ongoing OA stress.</p>
<p>If validated in field populations, CA7 could provide an early indicator of physiological strain before mortality increases.</p>

<section id="variability-as-resilience" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="variability-as-resilience">Variability as Resilience?</h2>
<p>Principal component analysis revealed another intriguing pattern: transcriptional variability increased under severe acidification.</p>
<p>Rather than shutting down metabolism — as seen in more sensitive species such as red king crab — snow crab maintained broad transcriptional activity.</p>
<p>This suggests that resilience may involve maintaining flexibility rather than suppressing activity. Transcriptional breadth could represent an adaptive strategy for coping with environmental change.</p>

<p>The PCA illustrates separation among treatments and highlights the stress-response and metabolic pathways driving that variation.</p>

</section>
<section id="what-this-means" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-this-means">What This Means</h2>
<p>Snow crab are not simply tolerant or sensitive. They are tolerant — up to a point.</p>
<p>Short-term exposure activates powerful metabolic and repair systems. Moderate acidification can be compensated for through regulatory adjustments. Severe acidification, however, induces sustained cellular stress that precedes visible effects by months.</p>
<p>This study reinforces a critical lesson:</p>
<p>Absence of early physiological change does not mean absence of impact.</p>
<p>Sublethal molecular stress can accumulate long before survival declines.</p>
<p>As high-latitude oceans continue to acidify, identifying these hidden thresholds becomes essential for predicting the future of snow crab populations and the fisheries that depend on them.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 






<p>Last week I traveled to Chile to teach at the Austral Summer Institute and spend time with collaborators at the University of Concepción through our ongoing INCAR2 partnership. It was one of those trips that reminds me why I enjoy this work so much—bringing together students, colleagues, and real-world systems to explore how molecular biology connects to environmental change and aquaculture sustainability.</p>
<p>At the Summer Institute, I taught Epigenomics in Aquaculture (EpiAqua) to an outstanding group of graduate students and postdoctoral researchers from across South America. The course focused on how epigenetic mechanisms—especially DNA methylation and non-coding RNAs—mediate organismal responses to stress, and how these tools can be applied in aquaculture and climate resilience research.</p>

<p>What stood out most was the energy in the room. Students came from diverse backgrounds spanning ecology, physiology, genomics, and applied aquaculture, which led to thoughtful discussions about experimental design, data integration, and how to move from sequencing data to actionable insight. These kinds of exchanges are incredibly motivating—and they’re exactly how new collaborations and ideas begin.</p>
<p>After the course, I spent time at the University of Concepción continuing work with INCAR2 colleagues. Together we moved forward on several exciting new directions, including:</p>
<p>• Penguin epigenetics, exploring how environmental exposure may be reflected in epigenomic variation in wild populations.</p>
<p>• Sea lice sex determination, aimed at understanding molecular mechanisms that could inform management strategies in salmon aquaculture.</p>
<p>• Presence–absence variation (PAV) in trout ecomorphs, investigating how structural genomic differences may contribute to ecological specialization.</p>
<p>Each of these projects fits into our broader goal of linking genomics and epigenomics to physiology, performance, and resilience in aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Following the academic portion of the trip, I also had the opportunity to visit salmon farms in southern Chile. Seeing production systems firsthand always adds important perspective—connecting lab-based molecular work to the environmental realities faced by farmers and managers. These visits reinforced why translational research matters: our models and datasets ultimately need to work in complex, real-world settings.</p>

<p>Overall, the trip was a great reminder of the value of international partnerships and immersive training environments. Teaching at the Austral Summer Institute and collaborating with INCAR2 continues to strengthen a shared vision around environmental memory, aquaculture sustainability, and training the next generation of scientists.</p>
<p>I’m grateful to our host, Dr.&nbsp;Cristian Gallardo and collaborators in Chile for their generosity and enthusiasm—and I’m excited to build on these new projects in the months ahead.</p>

  <title>Can Oyster Parents Prepare Their Offspring for What’s Next?</title>
  <dc:creator>Steven Roberts</dc:creator>

  <description><![CDATA[ 






<p><em>New research from the Roberts Lab reveals that immune “training” in adult oysters can reshape how their offspring grow, metabolize energy, and survive extreme heat.</em></p>
<p>Marine heatwaves and disease outbreaks are increasingly hitting oyster farms and wild populations at the same time. For Pacific oysters (<em>Magallana gigas</em>), this deadly combination often shows up as <strong>summer mortality events</strong>, when up to 90% of animals can die in a matter of days. But what if oyster parents could “prepare” their offspring for these stressful conditions before they are even born?</p>
<p>A new study from our lab, led by <strong>Madeline Baird</strong> and <strong>Ariana Huffmyer</strong> provides exciting evidence that they can.</p>
<section id="training-oyster-parents-immune-systems" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="training-oyster-parents-immune-systems"><strong>Training oyster parents’ immune systems</strong></h2>
<p>In this study, adult Pacific oysters were briefly exposed to <strong>Poly(I:C)</strong>, a harmless synthetic molecule that mimics viral infection and activates the oyster immune system. This kind of immune priming has been shown to increase disease resistance in oysters—but here we asked a different question:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Does immune priming in parents change how their offspring handle heat and metabolic stress?</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>After the exposure, oysters were spawned, and their larvae were reared in commercial hatchery conditions and then grown into seed oysters over several months. These offspring were later tested for <strong>growth, survival under heat stress, and metabolic performance</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="https://faculty.washington.edu/sr320/posts/frontpage/sr320-polyic/info.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
</section>
<section id="faster-growth-in-primed-families" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="faster-growth-in-primed-families"><strong>Faster growth in primed families</strong></h2>
<p>The first surprise was growth.</p>
<p>Although offspring from primed parents were slightly smaller early on, they grew faster over time and ended up <strong>larger than controls by 236 days post-fertilization</strong>. In other words, immune priming in parents altered how energy was allocated during development—suggesting a shift in developmental strategy.</p>
<p>This matters for hatcheries, where faster-growing seed often perform better during nursery and grow-out phases.</p>
</section>
<section id="heat-survival-depends-on-how-hot-it-gets" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="heat-survival-depends-on-how-hot-it-gets"><strong>Heat survival depends on how hot it gets</strong></h2>
<p>Next, the team exposed oysters to temperatures ranging from normal conditions to extreme heat (up to 45°C) and measured survival.</p>
<p>The results were strikingly <strong>temperature-specific</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>At <strong>40°C</strong>, offspring from primed parents were <strong>35% more likely to survive</strong> than controls&nbsp;</p></li>
<li><p>At <strong>42°C</strong>, however, those same primed offspring were <strong>more likely to die</strong> than controls&nbsp;</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This shows that immune priming doesn’t simply make oysters “tougher”—it reshapes <strong>where their thermal limits lie</strong>. In a warming ocean, that nuance matters.</p>
</section>
<section id="metabolism-tells-the-story" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="metabolism-tells-the-story"><strong>Metabolism tells the story</strong></h2>
<p>Why did primed offspring survive better at 40°C but worse at 42°C? The answer appears to lie in their <strong>metabolism</strong>.</p>
<p>Using a high-throughput <strong>resazurin assay</strong>, the team measured how quickly oysters processed energy under different temperatures&nbsp; .</p>
<p>They found:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>At <strong>36°C</strong>, primed offspring had <strong>43% higher metabolic activity</strong> than controls</p></li>
<li><p>At <strong>40°C</strong>, primed offspring showed <strong>lower metabolic activity</strong> than controls&nbsp;</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This pattern suggests that immune priming increases <strong>metabolic flexibility</strong>—the ability to ramp metabolism up under moderate stress and suppress it when conditions become extreme. That flexibility is likely what allows primed oysters to survive better at 40°C by entering a kind of <strong>protective metabolic slowdown</strong>, a known survival strategy in stressed marine invertebrates.</p>
</section>
<section id="a-form-of-environmental-memory" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-form-of-environmental-memory"><strong>A form of environmental memory</strong></h2>
<p>These effects persisted for more than <strong>seven months after fertilization</strong>, long after early maternal provisioning should have faded. This points to deeper mechanisms of <strong>environmental memory</strong>, potentially involving:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>altered maternal lipid and energy provisioning</p></li>
<li><p>immune-related transcripts passed into eggs</p></li>
<li><p>changes in microbiomes</p></li>
<li><p>epigenetic regulation (DNA methylation, non-coding RNAs)&nbsp;</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Together, these mechanisms may allow oysters to transmit information about parental stress environments directly to the next generation.</p>
</section>
<section id="what-does-this-mean-for-aquaculture" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-does-this-mean-for-aquaculture"><strong>What does this mean for aquaculture?</strong></h2>
<p>This research opens the door to a new idea:</p>
<p><strong>Hatcheries could condition broodstock before spawning to improve offspring performance.</strong></p>
<p>Because Poly(I:C) can be delivered by simple <strong>immersion</strong>, it could be integrated into existing hatchery workflows as a scalable, non-invasive treatment. When paired with selective breeding, immune priming might help produce oyster seed that is more resilient to heatwaves and disease—two of the biggest threats to modern shellfish farming.<br>
</p>
<p>At the same time, the study makes clear that <strong>priming is not a magic bullet</strong>. Benefits depended strongly on temperature, and extreme heat erased them. Field trials and longer-term studies are needed before these tools can be used widely.</p>
</section>
<section id="why-this-matters" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-this-matters"><strong>Why this matters</strong></h2>
<p>As oceans warm and pathogens spread, oysters are being pushed toward their physiological limits. This study shows that <strong>parents matter</strong>—and that immune experiences in one generation can shape how the next generation grows, survives, and uses energy.</p>
<p>That’s environmental memory in action.</p>
<p>And it may become one of our most powerful tools for building climate-resilient aquaculture in the decades ahead.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction">🌊 Introduction</h3>
<p>Ocean acidification (OA) poses one of the most pressing threats to marine calcifiers. As CO₂ dissolves into seawater, pH declines and carbonate saturation drops — creating a chemical environment that makes it harder for larval shellfish to build and maintain shells. Early life stages, from embryos to D-veligers, are especially vulnerable.</p>
<p>A new paper by <strong>Emma Timmins-Schiffman et al.&nbsp;(2025)</strong> presents hopeful evidence that <strong>maternal signaling</strong>—the physiological messages passed from mothers to offspring—can help larvae weather these conditions. The study, published in <em>Aquaculture</em>, demonstrates that <strong>broodstock conditioning under low-pH conditions</strong> can increase <strong>larval survival</strong> and <strong>developmental success</strong> under ocean acidification.</p>

<p>In a new preprint titled <a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.11.06.686367"><em>From Blue to Pink: Resazurin as a High-Throughput Proxy for Metabolic Rate in Oysters</em></a>, Ariana S.

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-new-colorful-window-into-oyster-metabolism"><strong>🌊 A New Colorful Window into Oyster Metabolism</strong></h3>
<p>Resazurin, a redox-sensitive dye used for decades in biomedical and microbial assays, shifts from <strong>blue to pink</strong> as it’s reduced by metabolic activity. Huffmyer et al.&nbsp;adapted this dye-based reaction — familiar to many cell biologists — to <strong>whole oysters</strong>, showing that fluorescence intensity closely tracks oxygen consumption and reflects metabolic performance at the organismal level .</p>
<p>The team developed a standardized, scalable protocol using multi-well plates and fluorometric readings to quantify metabolic rate across hundreds of individuals at once. This makes it one of the first <strong>high-throughput metabolic assays for live shellfish</strong>, an enormous advance for aquaculture and climate resilience research.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="metabolism-under-pressure-what-the-color-shift-reveals"><strong>🔥 Metabolism Under Pressure: What the Color Shift Reveals</strong></h3>
<p>By exposing oysters (<em>Crassostrea gigas</em> and <em>C. virginica</em>) to temperature gradients and acute heat shocks, the researchers observed predictable “thermal performance curves” — metabolism peaked near <strong>36 °C</strong> before declining sharply at higher temperatures. Notably, oysters that <strong>suppressed metabolism</strong> under extreme stress were <strong>more likely to survive</strong>, suggesting that <strong>metabolic depression is a hallmark of thermal resilience</strong>.</p>
<p>The assay also captured <strong>family-level differences</strong> in metabolic response, indicating that some oyster lineages are genetically predisposed to handle stress better than others. In a large-scale breeding experiment at the Virginia Institute of Marine Science, metabolic rates measured by resazurin correlated with <strong>predicted survival performance</strong> in selectively bred oyster families .</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-this-matters"><strong>🧬 Why This Matters</strong></h3>
<p>Metabolic rate is one of the most fundamental indicators of animal health and stress, but it’s historically been <strong>difficult and time-consuming to measure</strong> in shellfish. The resazurin assay overcomes that bottleneck, offering:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>High-throughput capability:</strong> hundreds of oysters per run</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Low cost and minimal equipment</strong> (a simple plate reader suffices)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Compatibility with live animals</strong> — no lethal sampling required</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Potential for integration with breeding and monitoring programs</strong></p></li>
</ul>
<p>These advantages make it a game-changer for <strong>aquaculture, ecology, and conservation</strong>, enabling rapid screening of stress resilience across populations and environments.</p>

<p>As marine ecosystems face intensifying heatwaves and acidification, tools like the resazurin assay can help hatcheries, farmers, and researchers identify the oysters most likely to thrive under stress. The study’s message is clear: <strong>color can tell a powerful physiological story</strong>.</p>
<p>Blue means rest. Pink means life. And somewhere between those hues lies the key to building a more resilient future for oysters — and the people who depend on them.</p>

<p>We are excited to share a new study led jointly by <strong>Dr.&nbsp;Mackenzie Gavery (NOAA Northwest Fisheries Science Center)</strong> and <strong>Dr.&nbsp;Lauren Vandepas (UW School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences)</strong>, who served as co–first authors on a major advance in marine developmental biology and applied aquaculture biotechnology.</p>
<p>The paper — <em>“Primordial germ cell specification and early developmental cell states in Pacific oyster”</em> — provides the <strong>earliest single-cell RNA-seq atlas ever produced from a bivalve embryo</strong>, capturing the transition from cleavage to gastrulation and revealing when and how primordial germ cells (PGCs) are formed in the Pacific oyster.</p>

<section id="why-germ-cells-matter-for-aquaculture" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-germ-cells-matter-for-aquaculture">Why Germ Cells Matter for Aquaculture</h2>
<p>Germ cells give rise to gametes (eggs and sperm) and are the cellular “gatekeepers” of reproduction. For marine aquaculture, the ability to <strong>reliably produce sterile animals</strong> is essential for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Preventing genetic introgression of hatchery lines into wild populations</li>
<li>Minimizing ecological risk of non-native stock</li>
<li>Improving meat quality and energy allocation in culture</li>
<li>Increasing thermal and stress resilience during grow-out</li>
</ul>
<p>Triploidy has been the only scalable sterility tool used in oysters to date, but its performance declines under environmental stress. This work opens the door to <strong>next-generation sterility strategies</strong> based on targeted disruption of germ cell formation — an approach already used successfully in some finfish species.</p>

  <title>Using Metabolomics and Lipidomics to Unlock Marine Resilience</title>
  <dc:creator>Steven Roberts</dc:creator>

  <description><![CDATA[ 






<p>How do marine organisms adapt to an ocean that is rapidly warming, acidifying, and changing in countless other ways? A new <strong>Perspective article in Integrative and Comparative Biology</strong> by Yaamini R. Venkataraman and Ariana S. Huffmyer takes on this pressing question by focusing on <strong>metabolic plasticity</strong>—an organism’s capacity to adjust how it produces, allocates, and uses energy under stress.</p>
<p>The authors argue that while genomics, transcriptomics, and epigenomics have all advanced our understanding of stress responses, <strong>metabolomic and lipidomic approaches provide a direct lens into energy balance</strong>—a key driver of resilience. By quantifying the molecules that fuel and regulate cellular processes, researchers can uncover hidden physiological shifts that are invisible at the whole-organism level.</p>

<section id="why-this-matters" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-this-matters"><strong>Why This Matters</strong></h3>
<p>Marine ecosystems are on the front lines of climate change. From corals to clams, invertebrates must constantly adjust to stressors like heat waves, hypoxia, and ocean acidification. The paper highlights how metabolic and lipidomic tools can:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Detect subtle but critical energy shifts before mortality occurs.</p></li>
<li><p>Reveal differences in resilience between species, populations, and even sexes.</p></li>
<li><p>Provide early biomarkers of stress tolerance that can inform conservation and aquaculture.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="a-framework-for-best-practices" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-framework-for-best-practices"><strong>A Framework for Best Practices</strong></h3>
<p>Recognizing that metabolomic and lipidomic studies are still emerging in marine biology, Venkataraman and Huffmyer provide a <strong>roadmap for experimental design and analysis</strong>. Their recommendations include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Careful sampling and preservation to prevent artifacts.</p></li>
<li><p>Strategic use of targeted, semi-targeted, or untargeted analyses.</p></li>
<li><p>Embracing time series designs to capture dynamic shifts.</p></li>
<li><p>Integrating molecular data with physiological and phenotypic metrics.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>They also call for <strong>multi-omic integration</strong>—combining metabolomics and lipidomics with gene expression, epigenetics, and physiology—to link molecular mechanisms with whole-organism outcomes</p>
</section>
<section id="looking-ahead" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="looking-ahead"><strong>Looking Ahead</strong></h3>
<p>The Perspective synthesizes findings from 68 studies published between 1993 and 2025, showing both how far the field has come and where opportunities lie. Importantly, it underscores that the <strong>marine science community must embrace metabolic complexity</strong> if we are to anticipate and mitigate the impacts of climate change on ecosystems.</p>
<p><img src="http://gannet.fish.washington.edu/seashell/snaps/figure1.png" width="600"></p>
<p>By providing this framework, Venkataraman and Huffmyer hope to spark more rigorous, reproducible, and integrative research—work that can help answer one of the defining questions of our time: <strong>how will marine life persist in a rapidly changing ocean?</strong></p>

  <title>Building Resilient Oysters: Launching the SORMI Project</title>
  <dc:creator>Steven Roberts</dc:creator>
  <link>https://faculty.washington.edu/sr320/posts/frontpage/sr320-sormi/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 






<p>We are excited to share that our proposal, <em>Development of SORMI (Summer Oyster Resilience and Mortality Index): A Quantitative Tool for Improving Field Survival</em>, has been funded through the Western Regional Aquaculture Center. This multi-institutional effort will address one of the most pressing challenges in shellfish aquaculture—<strong>recurrent summer mortality in Pacific oysters</strong>.</p>
<section id="the-challenge" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-challenge"><strong>The Challenge</strong></h3>
<p>For decades, oyster growers across the West Coast have faced sudden, large-scale summer die-offs linked to rising seawater temperatures, disease, and other stressors. These events threaten farm productivity and the economic stability of the shellfish industry. Despite years of research, a single cause has never been identified. Instead, we are taking a new approach: focusing on why oysters survive rather than why they die.</p>
</section>
<section id="what-is-sormi" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-is-sormi"><strong>What Is SORMI?</strong></h3>
<p>SORMI—the <em>Summer Oyster Resilience and Mortality Index</em>—will be a <strong>generalized stress resilience index</strong> for Pacific oysters. By integrating a suite of physiological and metabolic assays, the index will help predict which oyster families are most resilient under real-world conditions. This tool will directly support breeding programs and hatcheries, providing a practical way to select for survival and reduce the frequency of catastrophic summer mortality events .</p>

<section id="our-role-at-uw" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="our-role-at-uw"><strong>Our Role at UW</strong></h3>
<p>At the Roberts Lab, our team will be leading development of innovative, high-throughput stress assays, including a new <a href="http://oyster.pink"><strong>resazurin-based metabolic assay</strong></a> we have been refining as a cost-effective, scalable way to measure oyster metabolism. We will also work closely with partners to analyze stress resilience across hundreds of oyster families and link these traits to field survival outcomes. Our focus is on providing growers and breeding programs with actionable, science-based tools that are accessible and easy to implement.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="project-leadership-and-partners"><strong>Project Leadership and Partners</strong></h3>
<p>This project is led by <strong>Bobbi Hudson</strong>, Executive Director of the <strong>Pacific Shellfish Institute (PSI)</strong>. The collaborative team brings together expertise and resources from across the region, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>University of Washington (Roberts Lab)</strong> – stress physiology and assay development</p></li>
<li><p><strong>USDA Agricultural Research Service (Neil Thompson, Pacific Oyster Genomic Selection project)</strong> – breeding program integration and genetic analysis</p></li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="implications-for-the-shellfish-industry"><strong>Implications for the Shellfish Industry</strong></h3>
<p>The ultimate goal of SORMI is to give oyster growers a <strong>practical decision-making tool</strong>. With a reliable index, farmers could anticipate when their stocks are stressed and take proactive measures—harvesting before a mortality event, adjusting management practices, or prioritizing resilient broodstock. For breeding programs, SORMI will add a measurable, heritable trait that can accelerate development of hardier oyster lines.</p>
<p>In short, this project will help secure the future of West Coast oyster farming by <strong>turning science into survival.</strong></p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 






<p>This spring, two outstanding undergraduate researchers in our lab—Genevieve Buchanan and Henry Berg—presented their senior capstone projects, showcasing months of hard work and scientific curiosity. Their research tackled critical questions related to marine invertebrate resilience in the face of environmental stress, and each presentation offered fresh insight into how shellfish species respond to changing ocean conditions.</p>
<section id="genevieve-buchanan-thermal-tolerance-in-a-stressful-world" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="genevieve-buchanan-thermal-tolerance-in-a-stressful-world">🦪 Genevieve Buchanan: Thermal Tolerance in a Stressful World</h2>
<p>Genevieve’s project, “Effects of Salinity and Ocean Acidification Stress on Pacific Oyster (Magallana gigas) Thermal Tolerance”, examined how prior exposure to low salinity and acidic conditions influences oyster survival during subsequent heat stress. Pacific oysters are economically vital to aquaculture industries and ecologically foundational to coastal ecosystems, yet they face increasing threats from climate change-induced stressors.</p>
<p>Through a carefully controlled experiment using oysters from the Point Whitney Shellfish Hatchery, Genevieve tested whether low pH or reduced salinity exposure would compound mortality under acute thermal stress. Her findings showed that, surprisingly, these prior stressors did not significantly impact thermal tolerance. This suggests that Pacific oysters may be energetically adapted to the variable conditions of the Pacific Northwest, offering a glimmer of hope for aquaculture resilience in the face of climate extremes.</p>

<p>Henry’s capstone, “Physiological Markers Associated with Byssus Attachment Following Environmental Perturbations in Marine Mussels”, focused on the byssal threads that mussels use to anchor themselves to surfaces—an essential trait for survival and aquaculture yield.</p>
<p>Comparing Mytilus trossulus and Mytilus galloprovincialis, Henry exposed mussels to ocean acidification, warming, and hypoxia, then measured thread production and metabolic rates. His results were striking: ocean acidification increased thread production in both species, while warming favored M. galloprovincialis. Hypoxia, however, drastically reduced thread output, particularly in M. galloprovincialis. These species-specific responses highlight the complexity of climate resilience and point to potential physiological markers that could inform aquaculture site selection and selective breeding strategies.</p>

<p>Projects were conducted under the guidance of Ariana Huffmyer and Matt George, respectively, and reflect the high caliber of undergraduate research in our lab. We are incredibly proud of Genevieve and Henry—not only for their scientific contributions but also for their clarity, creativity, and commitment to advancing our understanding of marine organism resilience in a changing world.</p>
