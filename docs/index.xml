  <title>Coral Larvae and Thermal Stress</title>
  <link>https://faculty.washington.edu/sr320/posts/frontpage/ariana-paper/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>As climate change continues to drive rising ocean temperatures, coral reef ecosystems face an unprecedented crisis. Coral bleaching events, characterized by the breakdown of the mutualistic relationship between corals and their algal endosymbionts (Symbiodiniaceae), have become increasingly common, threatening the persistence of coral reefs worldwide. While much research has focused on adult corals, new studies are shedding light on how early life stages respond to thermal stress. <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002875">A recent study by Huffmyer et al.&nbsp;(2024), published in&nbsp;<em>PLOS Biology</em></a>, provides novel insights into how coral larvae cope with increased temperatures by modifying nitrogen assimilation to stabilize symbiotic relationships and mitigate bleaching risk.</p>
<section id="the-crucial-role-of-coral-larvae-in-reef-resilience" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-crucial-role-of-coral-larvae-in-reef-resilience"><strong>The Crucial Role of Coral Larvae in Reef Resilience</strong></h3>
<p>Reef-building corals rely on their symbionts to produce energy-rich photosynthates that fuel metabolic processes. However, when subjected to thermal stress, this delicate exchange can be disrupted, leading to the expulsion of symbionts and loss of critical energy sources. Understanding how coral larvae respond to environmental stress is particularly important, as their ability to establish symbiosis and successfully settle onto reefs determines the future of coral populations.</p>
<p>The study focused on&nbsp;<em>Montipora capitata</em>, a dominant reef-building coral in Hawai‘i that vertically transmits Symbiodiniaceae to its offspring. The researchers subjected symbiotic larvae to a 2.5°C increase in temperature for three days and assessed metabolic responses, photosynthetic performance, and stable isotope-labeled metabolite exchange.</p>
</section>
<section id="key-findings-nitrogen-assimilation-as-a-protective-mechanism" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="key-findings-nitrogen-assimilation-as-a-protective-mechanism"><strong>Key Findings: Nitrogen Assimilation as a Protective Mechanism</strong></h3>
<p>Contrary to expectations, the study found that while larvae exhibited significant metabolic depression under high temperatures—indicated by a 19% reduction in respiration rates—they did not experience bleaching or a decline in survival and settlement rates. Photosynthetic activity remained stable, and the symbiont population density was maintained despite thermal stress.</p>
<p>A crucial discovery was that coral larvae increased ammonium assimilation and urea metabolism while sequestering nitrogen into dipeptides. This shift suggests that larvae actively modulate nitrogen cycling to maintain symbiotic balance. By limiting nitrogen availability to the symbionts, the coral hosts may be promoting sustained photosynthate translocation, ensuring that energy supply remains uninterrupted under heat stress.</p>
</section>
<section id="metabolic-trade-offs-and-implications-for-coral-survival" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="metabolic-trade-offs-and-implications-for-coral-survival"><strong>Metabolic Trade-offs and Implications for Coral Survival</strong></h3>
<p>While glucose translocation from symbiont to host was maintained, the study revealed reduced metabolism of glucose through central carbon pathways such as glycolysis. This metabolic shift implies a trade-off: larvae prioritize nitrogen assimilation over carbohydrate breakdown, potentially conserving energy for essential physiological functions.</p>
<p>The authors propose that nitrogen limitation imposed on Symbiodiniaceae encourages continued carbon transfer to the host, preventing the symbionts from hoarding fixed carbon, which could otherwise disrupt the mutualistic relationship. This mechanism highlights a potential resilience strategy in coral early life stages that may influence reef recovery following bleaching events.</p>
</section>
<section id="future-directions-and-conservation-implications" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="future-directions-and-conservation-implications"><strong>Future Directions and Conservation Implications</strong></h3>
<p>Understanding the physiological mechanisms that allow coral larvae to withstand heat stress has significant implications for reef conservation and restoration efforts. If coral larvae can naturally modulate nitrogen metabolism to maintain symbiosis, selective breeding or assisted evolution approaches may enhance these traits in vulnerable species.</p>
<p>Additionally, further research should investigate whether similar nitrogen assimilation strategies are present in adult corals or if this is a life-stage-specific adaptation. Given the increasing frequency of marine heatwaves, identifying and promoting heat-resilient traits in corals could be a crucial component of future conservation strategies.</p>
</section>
<section id="conclusion" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>
<p>Huffmyer et al.&nbsp;(2024) provide compelling evidence that coral larvae can mitigate thermal stress through nitrogen assimilation, maintaining stable symbiosis even under elevated temperatures. By uncovering this metabolic adaptation, the study advances our understanding of coral resilience mechanisms and underscores the importance of protecting early life stages in reef conservation efforts. As climate change accelerates, these insights may inform new strategies to support coral reef survival in a warming world.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p><strong>Chris is featured on UW’s “Be Boundless” site. Read full article <a href="https://www.washington.edu/boundless/turning-the-tide-marine-biology/">here</a>. Below is a short snippet of the feature along with an amazing video!</strong></p>
<p>On a windy June afternoon, Chris Mantegna, ’21, encourages a half-dozen undergraduates to flip over barnacle-studded rocks and sift through seaweed. Equipped with clipboards to record their findings, they’re creating a snapshot of the organisms in the island’s intertidal zone — from orange sea cucumbers to the camouflaged armored mollusks called chitons.</p>
<p>Mantegna, a third-year graduate student in aquatic and fishery sciences, has spent the past three summers in Washington’s San Juan Islands, mentoring undergrads here on Yellow Island — a pristine 11-acre nature preserve owned by the Nature Conservancy. She created this eight-week program for students to get their hands dirty in the field and learn cutting-edge lab techniques at the UW Friday Harbor Laboratories — where she had a transformational research experience herself as a Husky undergrad.</p>
<p>This mentorship program reflects Mantegna’s passion both for advancing the science and for making it more inclusive and accessible to others. Her face lights up when she spots a small chiton (her favorite) clinging to the bottom of a rock, and she invites others to feel the mollusk’s tough plated back. Even Mantegna’s doctoral work — examining the genetic response of shellfish to contaminants in Puget Sound waterways — has a focus on community outreach and environmental literacy.</p>

<p>Mantegna says we have a better chance at fighting climate change when everyone — scientists and community members — feels connected to their environment and each other. “I can tell you that the ocean is dying or that we have too much acidification,” says Mantegna, a U.S. Navy veteran who is the first in her family to graduate from college. “But it doesn’t matter if you’ve never had the chance to feel the joy that comes from this place.”</p>

  <title>Exploring Pacific Cod Resilience in a Warming Ocean</title>
  <dc:creator>Laura Spencer</dc:creator>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>In our latest update on the Pacific cod juvenile temperature study, we've gained deeper insights into how these remarkable fish respond to different temperatures. This research is part of a larger effort to understand the resilience of marine species in changing environments.</p>
<p><strong>Genetic Insights Reveal Population Origins</strong></p>
<p>We began with genetic analyses, using data from thousands of genetic markers to determine the origin of our experimental fish. All our test fish were linked to the spawning grounds in the western Gulf of Alaska (wGOA) and the Eastern Bering Sea (EBS). This finding allows us to focus on the thermal resilience of cod from this particular region, which is vital as they face shifts in temperature in their natural habitats.</p>
<p><img src="http://gannet.fish.washington.edu/seashell/snaps/2024-11-06_15-00-51.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p><strong>Temperature's Role in Energy and Lipid Storage</strong></p>
<p>Our collaborator Louise Copement analyzed liver lipids in these juvenile cod, focusing on triglycerides and other key lipid types that are crucial for overwinter survival. The results showed a clear trend: energy storage, primarily in the form of triglycerides, peaked at 9°C, then dropped sharply at higher temperatures, especially at 16°C. This suggests that extreme warmth could deplete essential energy reserves, reducing the fish's survival prospects in the cold winter months.</p>
<p><img src="http://gannet.fish.washington.edu/seashell/snaps/2024-11-06_15-01-47.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p><strong>Optimal Growth Temperatures and Physiological Responses</strong></p>
<p>We also observed that juvenile cod exhibit optimal growth at approximately 12.3°C, slightly higher than previous findings. With higher temperatures, growth rates plateau or decline, mirroring the energy storage patterns. Interestingly, the gene expression data from liver tissues revealed significant temperature-driven shifts, especially in energy production, lipid metabolism, and immune response genes. This molecular data adds a new layer to our understanding of temperature tolerance.</p>
<p><img src="http://gannet.fish.washington.edu/seashell/snaps/2024-11-06_15-01-22.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p><strong>Integrated Data: A Pathway to Genomic Resilience Markers</strong></p>
<p>Combining growth, lipid, and gene expression data, we've started identifying genes that correlate with enhanced resilience at specific temperatures. This approach could spotlight genetic markers for thermal resilience, offering clues about cod populations best suited to future ocean conditions.</p>
<p>In summary, this research underscores the delicate balance juvenile Pacific cod must maintain in their energy reserves and growth under variable temperatures. These findings will help guide conservation and management efforts as we work to protect Pacific cod populations in a warming world.</p>

  <link>https://faculty.washington.edu/sr320/posts/frontpage/sr320-usda-report/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>During this past year a series of hatchery-based environmental conditioning activities (referred to as hardening) were completed with oysters out-planted onto three farms to evaluate performance. Additionally, climate resiliency was assessed in hardened oysters under controlled conditions.</p>

<section id="farm-outplanting" class="level1">
<h1>Farm Outplanting</h1>
<p>Early in the season, a cohort of oysters were subject to (a) daily thermal hardening for approximately two weeks prior to out planting in hanging bags on a farm in Sequim Bay, alongside a control group. These oyster will be assessed in early Autumn 2024. Later in the season oysters were subjected to a more diverse series of hardening conditions with oyster split between two commercial farms, one located in Willapa Bay and a second in the San Juan Islands. The combination of age classes and hardening conditions were as follows: b) small seed / daily thermal hardening, c) adult / daily thermal hardening, d) small seed / weekly thermal hardening, e1) large seed / weekly thermal hardening, e2) large seed / weekly zero salinity hardening. These hardening activities spanned from several weeks to months. For all hardening efforts controls were also outplanted. Oysters out planted in Willapa Bay will be assessed for survival and growth in early September 2024. Oysters out planted in the San Juan Islands have be subject to more routine monitoring. At this site we are currently observing a trend where oysters subjected to the daily hardening regime are surviving better than controls.</p>

<h1>Physiological Assessment 1</h1>
<p>To assess the effectiveness of hardening within a hatchery setting, four ages classes of oysters were examined: adults (40-100mm), juveniles (20-55mm), seed (6-15mm), and spat ()1-6mm). In order to assess hardening potential and environmental memory, oysters were subject to an initial chronic temperature stress, then subjected to a secondary stress to see if the response to secondary stress was impacted by initial exposure. During the chronic temperature stress period, oysters from each age class were exposed to a daily 25ºC temperature spike. This repeated for 14 days starting on October 1. Control oysters from each cohort were maintained at an ambient temperature of approximately 17ºC during the same time period.</p>

<p>Adult oysters in stress conditions were also subject to mechanical stress at day 1, 7, and 48, which was induced by 15 minutes. At day 147 (7 weeks after initial chronic stress), both stressed and non-stressed adult, juvenile, spat, and seed were subjected to a secondary stress of 30 minutes in 32ºC. Gill tissue was sampled immediately after and placed into RNAlater. Spat and seed that were too small to dissect gill tissue were sampled whole with all tissue used in gene expression assays. To date we have analyzed gene expression data from seed and spat. There was no mortality during this trial. Hardening increased growth (compared to controls) in spat. Further there was a reduced transcriptional response in spat. These data suggest temperature hardening of spat could result in a resiliency to later temperature stress whereby energy resources could favor growth.</p>

<h1>Physiological Assessment 2</h1>
<p>In a second experimental regime, juvenile oysters were subjected to four hardening conditions 1) high temperature (35°C), 2) high temperature and freshwater, 3) freshwater, and 4) poly I:C immersion. These were exposures that occurred every other day for about 3 weeks. Approximately 1 month after hardening, oysters were brought to the lab and subjected to metabolic assessment using resazurin at 18°C and 42°C. Resazurin is a dye that is commonly used in cell viability, and it works by changing color as an organism consumes oxygen. Survival was assessed during the resazurin assay and 24 hours later. To date, our analysis suggests metabolic activity of the 42°C oysters was higher in the control oysters than previously hardened oysters. In the near future we will assess the relationship of metabolic activity and survival however it appears higher metabolic rate directly correlates with mortality. Taken together these sets of controlled experiments suggest hardening does have an impact on resiliency, though dependent on age, hardening duration, and subsequent environmental conditions.</p>

</div>
<p><strong>Overview of Field Day Activities</strong> The objective was to monitor the health and stress responses of oyster cohorts at the hatchery. Key activities included calibrating monitoring equipment, feeding the oysters, and assessing the impacts of temperature and freshwater stress.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Monitoring Equipment Calibration:</strong> Dr.&nbsp;Huffmyer set up and calibrated an Orion Star A325 probe to measure pH, temperature, and conductivity. By using buffers of varying pH and a conductivity solution, she ensured accurate measurements. The pH was measured on the NBS scale, considered sufficient since ocean acidification experiments weren’t being conducted.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Feeding Protocol:</strong> The oysters were pulse-fed, where approximately 1/3 of a 5-gallon bucket was distributed among the tanks. This ensured that the animals received sufficient nutrition.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Fluorometry and Physiochemical Measurements:</strong> Fluorometry measurements were conducted before and after feeding, providing data on oyster metabolic activity. Additionally, pH, temperature, and conductivity were measured across different tanks, offering valuable weekly insights into water quality.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Stress Testing Regimen:</strong> Dr.&nbsp;Huffmyer conducted a 30-minute stress test for specific oyster cohorts using freshwater and elevated temperature exposures. Animals were subjected to 25°C temperature and freshwater immersion, replicating environmental stressors they might face. Trays were labeled and organized by stressor type.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Growth Characterization:</strong> Size measurements were taken using a waterproof digital caliper. Cohorts were categorized based on their respective stressors, creating a comprehensive understanding of their growth patterns.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Ploidy Testing Preparations:</strong> A selection of oysters from different cohorts was collected for ploidy testing to distinguish between diploid and triploid oysters. They were stored in mesh bags, and the testing results would provide critical information for future breeding programs.</p></li>

<p><strong>Takeaways for Hatchery Science</strong> Dr.&nbsp;Huffmyer’s systematic approach highlights the significance of precise monitoring and stress testing in hatchery science. Understanding oyster resilience to environmental stressors is crucial for aquaculture sustainability. Her work at Point Whitney offers a detailed protocol that could be replicated or adapted by other researchers to monitor and improve hatchery operations.</p>
<p>The future of hatchery management will depend heavily on such frameworks, where real-time data collection and analysis enable researchers to respond promptly to environmental changes.</p>
