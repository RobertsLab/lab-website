  <title>Can Oyster Parents Prepare Their Offspring for What’s Next?</title>

<p><em>New research from the Roberts Lab reveals that immune “training” in adult oysters can reshape how their offspring grow, metabolize energy, and survive extreme heat.</em></p>
<p>Marine heatwaves and disease outbreaks are increasingly hitting oyster farms and wild populations at the same time. For Pacific oysters (<em>Magallana gigas</em>), this deadly combination often shows up as <strong>summer mortality events</strong>, when up to 90% of animals can die in a matter of days. But what if oyster parents could “prepare” their offspring for these stressful conditions before they are even born?</p>
<p>A new study from our lab, led by <strong>Madeline Baird</strong> and <strong>Ariana Huffmyer</strong> provides exciting evidence that they can.</p>
<section id="training-oyster-parents-immune-systems" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="training-oyster-parents-immune-systems"><strong>Training oyster parents’ immune systems</strong></h2>
<p>In this study, adult Pacific oysters were briefly exposed to <strong>Poly(I:C)</strong>, a harmless synthetic molecule that mimics viral infection and activates the oyster immune system. This kind of immune priming has been shown to increase disease resistance in oysters—but here we asked a different question:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Does immune priming in parents change how their offspring handle heat and metabolic stress?</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>After the exposure, oysters were spawned, and their larvae were reared in commercial hatchery conditions and then grown into seed oysters over several months. These offspring were later tested for <strong>growth, survival under heat stress, and metabolic performance</strong>.</p>
</section>
<section id="faster-growth-in-primed-families" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="faster-growth-in-primed-families"><strong>Faster growth in primed families</strong></h2>
<p>The first surprise was growth.</p>
<p>Although offspring from primed parents were slightly smaller early on, they grew faster over time and ended up <strong>larger than controls by 236 days post-fertilization</strong>. In other words, immune priming in parents altered how energy was allocated during development—suggesting a shift in developmental strategy.</p>
<p>This matters for hatcheries, where faster-growing seed often perform better during nursery and grow-out phases.</p>
</section>
<section id="heat-survival-depends-on-how-hot-it-gets" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="heat-survival-depends-on-how-hot-it-gets"><strong>Heat survival depends on how hot it gets</strong></h2>
<p>Next, the team exposed oysters to temperatures ranging from normal conditions to extreme heat (up to 45°C) and measured survival.</p>
<p>The results were strikingly <strong>temperature-specific</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>At <strong>40°C</strong>, offspring from primed parents were <strong>35% more likely to survive</strong> than controls&nbsp;</p></li>
<li><p>At <strong>42°C</strong>, however, those same primed offspring were <strong>more likely to die</strong> than controls&nbsp;</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This shows that immune priming doesn’t simply make oysters “tougher”—it reshapes <strong>where their thermal limits lie</strong>. In a warming ocean, that nuance matters.</p>
</section>
<section id="metabolism-tells-the-story" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="metabolism-tells-the-story"><strong>Metabolism tells the story</strong></h2>
<p>Why did primed offspring survive better at 40°C but worse at 42°C? The answer appears to lie in their <strong>metabolism</strong>.</p>
<p>Using a high-throughput <strong>resazurin assay</strong>, the team measured how quickly oysters processed energy under different temperatures&nbsp; .</p>
<p>They found:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>At <strong>36°C</strong>, primed offspring had <strong>43% higher metabolic activity</strong> than controls</p></li>
<li><p>At <strong>40°C</strong>, primed offspring showed <strong>lower metabolic activity</strong> than controls&nbsp;</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This pattern suggests that immune priming increases <strong>metabolic flexibility</strong>—the ability to ramp metabolism up under moderate stress and suppress it when conditions become extreme. That flexibility is likely what allows primed oysters to survive better at 40°C by entering a kind of <strong>protective metabolic slowdown</strong>, a known survival strategy in stressed marine invertebrates.</p>
</section>
<section id="a-form-of-environmental-memory" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-form-of-environmental-memory"><strong>A form of environmental memory</strong></h2>
<p>These effects persisted for more than <strong>seven months after fertilization</strong>, long after early maternal provisioning should have faded. This points to deeper mechanisms of <strong>environmental memory</strong>, potentially involving:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>altered maternal lipid and energy provisioning</p></li>
<li><p>immune-related transcripts passed into eggs</p></li>
<li><p>changes in microbiomes</p></li>
<li><p>epigenetic regulation (DNA methylation, non-coding RNAs)&nbsp;</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Together, these mechanisms may allow oysters to transmit information about parental stress environments directly to the next generation.</p>
</section>
<section id="what-does-this-mean-for-aquaculture" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-does-this-mean-for-aquaculture"><strong>What does this mean for aquaculture?</strong></h2>
<p>This research opens the door to a new idea:</p>
<p><strong>Hatcheries could condition broodstock before spawning to improve offspring performance.</strong></p>
<p>Because Poly(I:C) can be delivered by simple <strong>immersion</strong>, it could be integrated into existing hatchery workflows as a scalable, non-invasive treatment. When paired with selective breeding, immune priming might help produce oyster seed that is more resilient to heatwaves and disease—two of the biggest threats to modern shellfish farming.<br>
</p>
<p>At the same time, the study makes clear that <strong>priming is not a magic bullet</strong>. Benefits depended strongly on temperature, and extreme heat erased them. Field trials and longer-term studies are needed before these tools can be used widely.</p>
</section>
<section id="why-this-matters" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-this-matters"><strong>Why this matters</strong></h2>
<p>As oceans warm and pathogens spread, oysters are being pushed toward their physiological limits. This study shows that <strong>parents matter</strong>—and that immune experiences in one generation can shape how the next generation grows, survives, and uses energy.</p>
<p>That’s environmental memory in action.</p>
<p>And it may become one of our most powerful tools for building climate-resilient aquaculture in the decades ahead.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction">🌊 Introduction</h3>
<p>Ocean acidification (OA) poses one of the most pressing threats to marine calcifiers. As CO₂ dissolves into seawater, pH declines and carbonate saturation drops — creating a chemical environment that makes it harder for larval shellfish to build and maintain shells. Early life stages, from embryos to D-veligers, are especially vulnerable.</p>
<p>A new paper by <strong>Emma Timmins-Schiffman et al.&nbsp;(2025)</strong> presents hopeful evidence that <strong>maternal signaling</strong>—the physiological messages passed from mothers to offspring—can help larvae weather these conditions. The study, published in <em>Aquaculture</em>, demonstrates that <strong>broodstock conditioning under low-pH conditions</strong> can increase <strong>larval survival</strong> and <strong>developmental success</strong> under ocean acidification.</p>

<p>In a new preprint titled <a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.11.06.686367"><em>From Blue to Pink: Resazurin as a High-Throughput Proxy for Metabolic Rate in Oysters</em></a>, Ariana S. Huffmyer and colleagues demonstrate a powerful yet elegant way to measure how oysters breathe, grow, and cope with stress — by watching a color change.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-new-colorful-window-into-oyster-metabolism"><strong>🌊 A New Colorful Window into Oyster Metabolism</strong></h3>
<p>Resazurin, a redox-sensitive dye used for decades in biomedical and microbial assays, shifts from <strong>blue to pink</strong> as it’s reduced by metabolic activity. Huffmyer et al.&nbsp;adapted this dye-based reaction — familiar to many cell biologists — to <strong>whole oysters</strong>, showing that fluorescence intensity closely tracks oxygen consumption and reflects metabolic performance at the organismal level .</p>
<p>The team developed a standardized, scalable protocol using multi-well plates and fluorometric readings to quantify metabolic rate across hundreds of individuals at once. This makes it one of the first <strong>high-throughput metabolic assays for live shellfish</strong>, an enormous advance for aquaculture and climate resilience research.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="metabolism-under-pressure-what-the-color-shift-reveals"><strong>🔥 Metabolism Under Pressure: What the Color Shift Reveals</strong></h3>
<p>By exposing oysters (<em>Crassostrea gigas</em> and <em>C. virginica</em>) to temperature gradients and acute heat shocks, the researchers observed predictable “thermal performance curves” — metabolism peaked near <strong>36 °C</strong> before declining sharply at higher temperatures. Notably, oysters that <strong>suppressed metabolism</strong> under extreme stress were <strong>more likely to survive</strong>, suggesting that <strong>metabolic depression is a hallmark of thermal resilience</strong>.</p>
<p>The assay also captured <strong>family-level differences</strong> in metabolic response, indicating that some oyster lineages are genetically predisposed to handle stress better than others. In a large-scale breeding experiment at the Virginia Institute of Marine Science, metabolic rates measured by resazurin correlated with <strong>predicted survival performance</strong> in selectively bred oyster families .</p>

<section id="why-this-matters" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-this-matters"><strong>🧬 Why This Matters</strong></h3>
<p>Metabolic rate is one of the most fundamental indicators of animal health and stress, but it’s historically been <strong>difficult and time-consuming to measure</strong> in shellfish. The resazurin assay overcomes that bottleneck, offering:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>High-throughput capability:</strong> hundreds of oysters per run</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Low cost and minimal equipment</strong> (a simple plate reader suffices)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Compatibility with live animals</strong> — no lethal sampling required</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Potential for integration with breeding and monitoring programs</strong></p></li>
</ul>
<p>These advantages make it a game-changer for <strong>aquaculture, ecology, and conservation</strong>, enabling rapid screening of stress resilience across populations and environments.</p>

<p>As marine ecosystems face intensifying heatwaves and acidification, tools like the resazurin assay can help hatcheries, farmers, and researchers identify the oysters most likely to thrive under stress. The study’s message is clear: <strong>color can tell a powerful physiological story</strong>.</p>
<p>Blue means rest. Pink means life. And somewhere between those hues lies the key to building a more resilient future for oysters — and the people who depend on them.</p>

<p>We are excited to share a new study led jointly by <strong>Dr.&nbsp;Mackenzie Gavery (NOAA Northwest Fisheries Science Center)</strong> and <strong>Dr.&nbsp;Lauren Vandepas (UW School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences)</strong>, who served as co–first authors on a major advance in marine developmental biology and applied aquaculture biotechnology.</p>
<p>The paper — <em>“Primordial germ cell specification and early developmental cell states in Pacific oyster”</em> — provides the <strong>earliest single-cell RNA-seq atlas ever produced from a bivalve embryo</strong>, capturing the transition from cleavage to gastrulation and revealing when and how primordial germ cells (PGCs) are formed in the Pacific oyster.</p>

<section id="why-germ-cells-matter-for-aquaculture" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-germ-cells-matter-for-aquaculture">Why Germ Cells Matter for Aquaculture</h2>
<p>Germ cells give rise to gametes (eggs and sperm) and are the cellular “gatekeepers” of reproduction. For marine aquaculture, the ability to <strong>reliably produce sterile animals</strong> is essential for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Preventing genetic introgression of hatchery lines into wild populations</li>
<li>Minimizing ecological risk of non-native stock</li>
<li>Improving meat quality and energy allocation in culture</li>
<li>Increasing thermal and stress resilience during grow-out</li>
</ul>
<p>Triploidy has been the only scalable sterility tool used in oysters to date, but its performance declines under environmental stress. This work opens the door to <strong>next-generation sterility strategies</strong> based on targeted disruption of germ cell formation — an approach already used successfully in some finfish species.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 






<p>From April 2023 to March 2025, a team lead by <a href="https://faculty.washington.edu/sr320/people.html#chris-mantegna">Chris Mantegna</a> piloted Intertidal Innovators, an EarthLab Innovation Grant–funded program that blended art and science to connect local high school students with Seattle’s nearshore ecosystems. The program invited 11 students into a five-week internship where they explored foundational intertidal science concepts and translated their learning into creative expression.</p>
<section id="building-connections-through-art-and-science" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="building-connections-through-art-and-science">Building Connections Through Art and Science</h2>
<p>Working in small groups, students wrote, directed, photographed, and edited a geo-located guided walk through Golden Gardens Park, designed to reveal what remains hidden at high tide. Their final piece, The Golden Hour, is now publicly available on the <a href="https://explore.echoes.xyz/">Echoes app</a> for anyone to experience—on-site or remotely.</p>
<p>To celebrate the culmination of the program, students led family and community members on their guided walk at Golden Gardens. This showcase not only highlighted their new knowledge but also allowed them to teach their families about the shoreline environment, reinforcing connections across generations.</p>
<p>Alongside the student projects, the team developed a flexible art + science curriculum, including community-building activities, photography and sound recording methods, and editing techniques. This content has already been shared at national conferences, sparking dialogue on how to integrate creativity and environmental learning.</p>
</section>
<section id="lasting-impact-on-students-and-community" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="lasting-impact-on-students-and-community">Lasting Impact on Students and Community</h2>
<p>The program’s impact can be seen in three ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Student empowerment</strong> – Students gained literacy and comfort in their local environment, transforming initial unfamiliarity into curiosity and pride.</li>
<li><strong>Community engagement</strong> – Families participated enthusiastically in the showcase, with students confidently leading and teaching.</li>
<li><strong>Interdisciplinary learning</strong> – The program demonstrated how art can deepen science learning and strengthen environmental connection.</li>
</ul>
<p>Feedback from both students and families revealed a surprising outcome: parents expressed interest in participating alongside their children. Future iterations will explore opportunities to involve families more directly.</p>
</section>
<section id="what-we-learned" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-we-learned">What We Learned</h2>
<p>EarthLab’s support made this interdisciplinary experiment possible. We learned how to foster curiosity in high school students outside of traditional grading systems, how to effectively blend art and science as teaching tools, and how to build trust and community in creative learning spaces.</p>
<p>For future rounds, we plan to lengthen the program, weave art and science even more tightly together, and expand opportunities for community members to take part. Continued mentorship with Garfield High School students is already underway, with plans to build on their intertidal research and experiential learning credits in spring 2025.</p>
</section>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="looking-ahead">Looking Ahead</h2>
<p>Deliverables from Intertidal Innovators will continue to grow. In addition to the Echoes guided walk, an ArcGIS StoryMap and a complete open-source curriculum will be available by early 2026, along with a media library of student-created photos, videos, and recordings.</p>
<p>We are grateful to EarthLab for supporting this innovative project, and to our collaborators—UW School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences, UW DXARTS, Black in Marine Science, and Sea Potential—for making this work possible. Together, we’ve shown how art and science can inspire the next generation of environmental stewards.</p>

  <title>Using Metabolomics and Lipidomics to Unlock Marine Resilience</title>
  <dc:creator>Steven Roberts</dc:creator>
  <link>https://faculty.washington.edu/sr320/posts/frontpage/sr320-metab/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 






<p>How do marine organisms adapt to an ocean that is rapidly warming, acidifying, and changing in countless other ways? A new <strong>Perspective article in Integrative and Comparative Biology</strong> by Yaamini R. Venkataraman and Ariana S. Huffmyer takes on this pressing question by focusing on <strong>metabolic plasticity</strong>—an organism’s capacity to adjust how it produces, allocates, and uses energy under stress.</p>
<p>The authors argue that while genomics, transcriptomics, and epigenomics have all advanced our understanding of stress responses, <strong>metabolomic and lipidomic approaches provide a direct lens into energy balance</strong>—a key driver of resilience. By quantifying the molecules that fuel and regulate cellular processes, researchers can uncover hidden physiological shifts that are invisible at the whole-organism level.</p>

<section id="why-this-matters" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-this-matters"><strong>Why This Matters</strong></h3>
<p>Marine ecosystems are on the front lines of climate change. From corals to clams, invertebrates must constantly adjust to stressors like heat waves, hypoxia, and ocean acidification. The paper highlights how metabolic and lipidomic tools can:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Detect subtle but critical energy shifts before mortality occurs.</p></li>
<li><p>Reveal differences in resilience between species, populations, and even sexes.</p></li>
<li><p>Provide early biomarkers of stress tolerance that can inform conservation and aquaculture.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="a-framework-for-best-practices" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-framework-for-best-practices"><strong>A Framework for Best Practices</strong></h3>
<p>Recognizing that metabolomic and lipidomic studies are still emerging in marine biology, Venkataraman and Huffmyer provide a <strong>roadmap for experimental design and analysis</strong>. Their recommendations include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Careful sampling and preservation to prevent artifacts.</p></li>
<li><p>Strategic use of targeted, semi-targeted, or untargeted analyses.</p></li>
<li><p>Embracing time series designs to capture dynamic shifts.</p></li>
<li><p>Integrating molecular data with physiological and phenotypic metrics.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>They also call for <strong>multi-omic integration</strong>—combining metabolomics and lipidomics with gene expression, epigenetics, and physiology—to link molecular mechanisms with whole-organism outcomes</p>
</section>
<section id="looking-ahead" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="looking-ahead"><strong>Looking Ahead</strong></h3>
<p>The Perspective synthesizes findings from 68 studies published between 1993 and 2025, showing both how far the field has come and where opportunities lie. Importantly, it underscores that the <strong>marine science community must embrace metabolic complexity</strong> if we are to anticipate and mitigate the impacts of climate change on ecosystems.</p>
<p><img src="http://gannet.fish.washington.edu/seashell/snaps/figure1.png" width="600"></p>
<p>By providing this framework, Venkataraman and Huffmyer hope to spark more rigorous, reproducible, and integrative research—work that can help answer one of the defining questions of our time: <strong>how will marine life persist in a rapidly changing ocean?</strong></p>

  <title>Building Resilient Oysters: Launching the SORMI Project</title>
  <dc:creator>Steven Roberts</dc:creator>
  <link>https://faculty.washington.edu/sr320/posts/frontpage/sr320-sormi/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 






<p>We are excited to share that our proposal, <em>Development of SORMI (Summer Oyster Resilience and Mortality Index): A Quantitative Tool for Improving Field Survival</em>, has been funded through the Western Regional Aquaculture Center. This multi-institutional effort will address one of the most pressing challenges in shellfish aquaculture—<strong>recurrent summer mortality in Pacific oysters</strong>.</p>
<section id="the-challenge" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-challenge"><strong>The Challenge</strong></h3>
<p>For decades, oyster growers across the West Coast have faced sudden, large-scale summer die-offs linked to rising seawater temperatures, disease, and other stressors. These events threaten farm productivity and the economic stability of the shellfish industry. Despite years of research, a single cause has never been identified. Instead, we are taking a new approach: focusing on why oysters survive rather than why they die.</p>
</section>
<section id="what-is-sormi" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-is-sormi"><strong>What Is SORMI?</strong></h3>
<p>SORMI—the <em>Summer Oyster Resilience and Mortality Index</em>—will be a <strong>generalized stress resilience index</strong> for Pacific oysters. By integrating a suite of physiological and metabolic assays, the index will help predict which oyster families are most resilient under real-world conditions. This tool will directly support breeding programs and hatcheries, providing a practical way to select for survival and reduce the frequency of catastrophic summer mortality events .</p>
<p><img src="http://gannet.fish.washington.edu/seashell/snaps/Monosnap_SR_PSI_WRAC_2025_Full_Proposal_Draft_2025-09-06_06-35-37.png" class="img-fluid"></p>

<section id="our-role-at-uw" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="our-role-at-uw"><strong>Our Role at UW</strong></h3>
<p>At the Roberts Lab, our team will be leading development of innovative, high-throughput stress assays, including a new <a href="http://oyster.pink"><strong>resazurin-based metabolic assay</strong></a> we have been refining as a cost-effective, scalable way to measure oyster metabolism. We will also work closely with partners to analyze stress resilience across hundreds of oyster families and link these traits to field survival outcomes. Our focus is on providing growers and breeding programs with actionable, science-based tools that are accessible and easy to implement.</p>

<section id="project-leadership-and-partners" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="project-leadership-and-partners"><strong>Project Leadership and Partners</strong></h3>
<p>This project is led by <strong>Bobbi Hudson</strong>, Executive Director of the <strong>Pacific Shellfish Institute (PSI)</strong>. The collaborative team brings together expertise and resources from across the region, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>University of Washington (Roberts Lab)</strong> – stress physiology and assay development</p></li>
<li><p><strong>USDA Agricultural Research Service (Neil Thompson, Pacific Oyster Genomic Selection project)</strong> – breeding program integration and genetic analysis</p></li>
<li><p><strong>NOAA Fisheries (Mackenzie Gavery)</strong> – environmental physiology and genomics</p></li>
<li><p><strong>California Sea Grant (Kevin Johnson, Cal Poly)</strong> – aquaculture extension and grower engagement</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Industry partners</strong> – Goose Point Oyster Company (WA) and Hog Island Oyster Company (CA)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This broad coalition ensures the project is grounded in industry needs while pushing forward fundamental science .</p>
<p><img src="http://gannet.fish.washington.edu/seashell/snaps/Monosnap_SR_PSI_WRAC_2025_Full_Proposal_Draft_2025-09-06_06-36-23.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
</section>
<section id="implications-for-the-shellfish-industry" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="implications-for-the-shellfish-industry"><strong>Implications for the Shellfish Industry</strong></h3>
<p>The ultimate goal of SORMI is to give oyster growers a <strong>practical decision-making tool</strong>. With a reliable index, farmers could anticipate when their stocks are stressed and take proactive measures—harvesting before a mortality event, adjusting management practices, or prioritizing resilient broodstock. For breeding programs, SORMI will add a measurable, heritable trait that can accelerate development of hardier oyster lines.</p>
<p>In short, this project will help secure the future of West Coast oyster farming by <strong>turning science into survival.</strong></p>

  <title>Scientific Breakthrough in Sustainable Aquaculture</title>
  <dc:creator>Steven Roberts</dc:creator>
  <link>https://faculty.washington.edu/sr320/posts/frontpage/sr320-sablefish/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 






<p>As global demand for seafood continues to rise, the aquaculture industry faces growing pressure to produce more while minimizing ecological impacts. A key concern in marine fish farming is the risk of escapees interbreeding with wild populations, leading to genetic introgression and reduced fitness in native fish stocks. Now, a recent study led by former University of Washington CICOES postdoctoral researcher Dr.&nbsp;Yuzo R. Yanagitsuru offers a promising solution.</p>
<p>Published in <em>Aquaculture</em>, the study presents a <strong>proof-of-concept for a non-GMO, bath immersion–based technique for inducing sterility in sablefish (Anoplopoma fimbria)</strong>—an emerging high-value aquaculture species also known as black cod. The approach targets a gene essential for reproductive cell development and aims to prevent escaped farmed fish from reproducing in the wild.</p>
<section id="a-scalable-gene-silencing-alternative-to-triploidy" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-scalable-gene-silencing-alternative-to-triploidy"><strong>A Scalable, Gene-Silencing Alternative to Triploidy</strong></h3>
<p>While triploidization and genetic modification have been explored for sterility induction, both come with drawbacks—triploid fish can still be partially fertile, and GM fish face regulatory and public acceptance hurdles.</p>
<p>Instead, Dr.&nbsp;Yanagitsuru and collaborators used a <strong>Morpholino oligomer (MO)</strong> attached to a <strong>Vivo transporter</strong> to silence the <em>dead end</em> (<em>dnd</em>) gene—a critical regulator of primordial germ cell formation. The innovation lies in delivering this compound through a <strong>simple bath immersion</strong>, rather than invasive microinjection or genetic alteration.</p>
</section>
<section id="results-a-step-toward-sterile-sustainable-farming" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="results-a-step-toward-sterile-sustainable-farming"><strong>Results: A Step Toward Sterile, Sustainable Farming</strong></h3>
<p>In controlled hatchery trials, sablefish eggs treated with the dnd-MO-Vivo compound before fertilization produced a subset of individuals that were completely sterile (8%) or had drastically reduced numbers of reproductive cells (18%). Importantly, sterile individuals developed normally in all other respects: they showed no major differences in growth, sex steroid hormone levels, or survival under semi-commercial rearing conditions.</p>
<p>Key findings include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target specificity</strong>: dnd expression was limited to gonads and unfertilized eggs, confirming its value as a marker for germ cell presence.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>No adverse health effects</strong>: Sterile fish were physiologically indistinguishable from fertile fish in terms of somatic growth and overall condition.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Higher efficacy pre-fertilization</strong>: The sterility induction was more effective when the treatment was applied before fertilization, likely due to increased permeability of the egg chorion.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="why-it-matters" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-it-matters"><strong>Why It Matters</strong></h3>
<p>This method opens a new path for <strong>scalable, publicly acceptable sterility induction in marine finfish aquaculture</strong>. By eliminating the reproductive capability of escapees, it reduces ecological risk and helps safeguard the genetic integrity of wild populations—while also offering potential gains in growth efficiency and product quality for farmers.</p>
<p>Sablefish, already known for its rich flavor and high omega-3 content, now also stands to become a model species for innovative, sustainable aquaculture practices.</p>
</section>
<section id="whats-next" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="whats-next"><strong>What’s Next?</strong></h3>
<p>The authors emphasize that <strong>further optimization is needed</strong> to improve sterility rates and ensure consistent results across large-scale operations. Future research will likely explore different concentrations, immersion times, and additional species to assess broader applicability.</p>
<p>But for now, this work—driven by Dr.&nbsp;Yanagitsuru’s leadership—marks an important milestone in the development of non-GMO solutions to one of aquaculture’s biggest challenges.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 






<p>This spring, two outstanding undergraduate researchers in our lab—Genevieve Buchanan and Henry Berg—presented their senior capstone projects, showcasing months of hard work and scientific curiosity. Their research tackled critical questions related to marine invertebrate resilience in the face of environmental stress, and each presentation offered fresh insight into how shellfish species respond to changing ocean conditions.</p>
<section id="genevieve-buchanan-thermal-tolerance-in-a-stressful-world" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="genevieve-buchanan-thermal-tolerance-in-a-stressful-world">🦪 Genevieve Buchanan: Thermal Tolerance in a Stressful World</h2>
<p>Genevieve’s project, “Effects of Salinity and Ocean Acidification Stress on Pacific Oyster (Magallana gigas) Thermal Tolerance”, examined how prior exposure to low salinity and acidic conditions influences oyster survival during subsequent heat stress. Pacific oysters are economically vital to aquaculture industries and ecologically foundational to coastal ecosystems, yet they face increasing threats from climate change-induced stressors.</p>
<p>Through a carefully controlled experiment using oysters from the Point Whitney Shellfish Hatchery, Genevieve tested whether low pH or reduced salinity exposure would compound mortality under acute thermal stress. Her findings showed that, surprisingly, these prior stressors did not significantly impact thermal tolerance. This suggests that Pacific oysters may be energetically adapted to the variable conditions of the Pacific Northwest, offering a glimmer of hope for aquaculture resilience in the face of climate extremes.</p>

<p>Henry’s capstone, “Physiological Markers Associated with Byssus Attachment Following Environmental Perturbations in Marine Mussels”, focused on the byssal threads that mussels use to anchor themselves to surfaces—an essential trait for survival and aquaculture yield.</p>
<p>Comparing Mytilus trossulus and Mytilus galloprovincialis, Henry exposed mussels to ocean acidification, warming, and hypoxia, then measured thread production and metabolic rates. His results were striking: ocean acidification increased thread production in both species, while warming favored M. galloprovincialis. Hypoxia, however, drastically reduced thread output, particularly in M. galloprovincialis. These species-specific responses highlight the complexity of climate resilience and point to potential physiological markers that could inform aquaculture site selection and selective breeding strategies.</p>

<p><a href="https://shedurkin.github.io/Roberts-LabNotebook/">Kathleen</a> has received a fellowship to conduct groundbreaking research at the <strong>Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History</strong>, where she will pioneer the use of <strong>nanopore sequencing to map DNA methylation in archival coral specimens</strong>. Her project represents one of the first efforts to explore historical DNA methylation (hDNA) in invertebrates using museum collections.</p>
<p>Drawing from coral samples that span over a century of collection history, Kathleen’s work will assess how epigenetic changes—particularly DNA methylation—can offer insights into coral stress responses and environmental resilience over time. By applying Oxford Nanopore Technology’s direct sequencing platform, she aims to overcome the limitations of traditional bisulfite sequencing in degraded DNA and establish a robust method for tracking historical epigenomic signatures.</p>
<p>This innovative research will not only advance our understanding of coral adaptation during a period of unprecedented climate change but also expand the utility of natural history collections for modern genomic and conservation science.</p>
<hr>
<p>These fellowships reflect the drive and creativity that Zach and Kathleen bring to their work, and we are excited to watch their projects unfold over the coming year. Their success exemplifies the kind of interdisciplinary, forward-thinking science that will shape the future of marine conservation and climate adaptation.</p>
<p>Please join us in congratulating Zachary and Kathleen on these outstanding achievements!</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 






<p>At EPIMAR2025 in Barcelona, a gathering of global marine scientists illuminated the hidden world of epigenetic regulation in marine invertebrates. These tiny organisms, often overlooked in genomic studies, are now at the forefront of revealing how life beneath the waves adapts, survives, and thrives in rapidly changing oceans.</p>
<p>In this post, we highlight key presentations that explored how DNA methylation, RNA modifications, and chromatin remodeling influence invertebrate development, stress response, and even intergenerational adaptation.</p>

  <title>Environmental Priming in Practice</title>
  <dc:creator>Steven Roberts</dc:creator>
  <link>https://faculty.washington.edu/sr320/posts/sr320-lewis-smith/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 






<p>We're proud to share a new publication by former lab member <strong>Connor Lewis-Smith</strong>, now a Social Scientist with NOAA's Northwest Fisheries Science Center. His article, <em>"Navigating ocean acidification in shellfish aquaculture: Stakeholder perspectives of developing strategies in the U.S. Pacific Region"</em>, was just released in <em>Aquaculture Reports</em> and offers an in-depth look at how shellfish growers across the U.S. Pacific Coast are responding to ocean acidification and related environmental stressors.</p>
<p>The study draws on structured interviews with producers from Washington, Oregon, California, Alaska, and Hawaii to capture evolving perceptions of ocean acidification and industry interest in emerging adaptation strategies. Notably, concern about ocean acidification appears to have declined in the past decade, as growers increasingly focus on intersecting threats such as harmful algal blooms, disease, and rising temperatures.</p>
<p>The paper explores two adaptation strategies under development: <strong>parental priming</strong>—a technique involving exposure of broodstock to stressful conditions to enhance offspring resilience—and <strong>native species portfolio expansion</strong>. While industry support for both strategies was mixed and often contingent on further scientific validation, the study emphasizes the importance of early engagement between researchers and growers to co-develop viable solutions.</p>
<p>Importantly, this research aligns directly with <strong>ongoing environmental priming work in our lab</strong>, where we are experimentally testing how exposure to low pH and high temperature conditions in adult shellfish can influence offspring performance. By integrating physiological, transcriptomic, and lipidomic data, our current NOAA-funded work seeks to identify the mechanisms underlying carryover effects and inform hatchery practices that enhance larval resilience under future ocean conditions.</p>
<p>Connor's collaboration with our group helped build the interdisciplinary foundation for this kind of applied science—where social, biological, and ecological factors intersect to shape adaptation in real-world settings. We're excited to see how his work complements and extends our efforts to support a more resilient shellfish aquaculture sector.</p>

  <title>Exploring the Non-Coding RNA Landscape in Reef-Building Corals</title>
  <link>https://faculty.washington.edu/sr320/posts/sr320-lncRNA-rep/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 






<p>Coral reefs are among the most biodiverse ecosystems on the planet, yet they are increasingly threatened by climate change and human activities. Understanding the molecular mechanisms that govern coral resilience is crucial for their conservation. A <a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.03.15.643469.">new study by Ashey et al.&nbsp;(2025)</a> provides a groundbreaking look into the non-coding RNA (ncRNA) repertoire of reef-building corals, shedding light on how these regulatory molecules contribute to coral gene expression and environmental adaptability.</p>
<section id="why-non-coding-rnas-matter" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-non-coding-rnas-matter"><strong>Why Non-Coding RNAs Matter</strong></h3>
<p>Long dismissed as “junk” DNA, ncRNAs have emerged as vital regulators of gene expression across all domains of life. Unlike protein-coding genes, ncRNAs do not translate into proteins but instead play critical roles in controlling genetic pathways, chromatin organization, and stress responses. In corals, these molecules could be key players in their ability to withstand environmental stressors such as rising ocean temperatures and pollution.</p>

  <title>Unlocking the Future of Shellfish Aquaculture Through Genomics</title>
  <link>https://faculty.washington.edu/sr320/posts/sr320-genomics/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 






<p>Aquaculture is undergoing a revolution. The integration of cutting-edge genomic tools into breeding programs is transforming the industry, allowing for enhanced growth rates, disease resistance, and environmental adaptability in farmed species. While finfish often take center stage in discussions about genomic innovation, shellfish—particularly oysters, clams, and other bivalves—stand to benefit tremendously from these advancements. A recent review by <a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12864-025-11247-z">Andersen et al.&nbsp;(2025), published in BMC Genomics</a>, outlines the progress and future priorities for U.S. aquaculture genomics, with significant implications for shellfish industries.</p>
<section id="why-genomics-matters-for-shellfish" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-genomics-matters-for-shellfish">Why Genomics Matters for Shellfish</h2>
<p>Shellfish farming is a cornerstone of coastal economies, providing a sustainable protein source while contributing to water filtration and habitat structure. However, challenges such as disease outbreaks, climate change-driven stressors (e.g., ocean acidification, salinity fluctuations), and genetic bottlenecks in breeding programs pose significant hurdles. The integration of genomics and multi-omics approaches is helping researchers and industry stakeholders address these issues head-on.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Advancing Reference Genomes for Shellfish</li>
</ol>
<p>One of the key priorities identified in the review is the need for high-quality genome assemblies for shellfish species. Reference genomes serve as blueprints for breeding programs, guiding selective breeding efforts toward desirable traits such as disease resistance, growth efficiency, and stress tolerance.</p>
<p>For instance:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The Pacific oyster (Magallana gigas) and Eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) now have improved genome assemblies, which are crucial for mapping genes associated with disease resilience.</p></li>
<li><p>Structural variations in oyster genomes have been linked to breeding success, helping hatcheries refine their selection of broodstock.</p></li>
<li><p>Functional annotation efforts, like those undertaken by the international FAANG (Functional Annotation of ANimal Genomes) initiative, are improving our understanding of how genes are regulated in response to environmental stressors.</p></li>
</ul>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Multi-Omics Approaches: Beyond the Genome</li>
</ol>
<p>While genomic sequencing provides a foundational understanding of shellfish biology, integrating other “omics” layers—epigenomics, transcriptomics, and microbiomics—adds depth to the picture.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Epigenomics &amp; Environmental Adaptation: Studies have shown that DNA methylation plays a key role in how oysters respond to stress, such as changes in salinity and temperature. This suggests that breeding for resilience might not just be about genetics but also about harnessing heritable epigenetic modifications.</p></li>
<li><p>Transcriptomics &amp; Disease Resistance: RNA sequencing has revealed that oysters activate specific immune pathways when exposed to pathogens like Perkinsus marinus (which causes Dermo disease). Understanding these pathways helps identify candidate genes for selective breeding.</p></li>
<li><p>Microbiomics &amp; Shellfish Health: The microbial communities living on and inside shellfish significantly impact their growth and survival. Some studies suggest that manipulating the oyster microbiome could enhance disease resistance.</p></li>
</ul>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Genomic Selection &amp; Breeding Programs</li>
</ol>
<p>Traditional shellfish breeding has relied on mass selection or family-based selection, which can be slow and inefficient. Genomic selection—where DNA markers are used to predict an individual’s breeding value—has revolutionized selective breeding in finfish and livestock, and now it is being applied to shellfish.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The use of genomic selection in oysters is improving survival rates in low-salinity environments, a crucial trait given the increasing frequency of extreme weather events that introduce large freshwater inputs into coastal farming areas.</p></li>
<li><p>Marker-assisted selection (MAS) is being employed to accelerate breeding for traits like shell strength, which is vital for both consumer preference and post-harvest handling.</p></li>
<li><p>Researchers are also exploring CRISPR and other gene-editing technologies to validate gene function, though regulatory challenges remain.</p></li>
</ul>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>Overcoming Challenges: From Research to Industry Application</li>
</ol>
<p>Despite these advancements, challenges remain in translating genomic discoveries into tangible benefits for shellfish farmers.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Cost &amp; Accessibility: While sequencing costs are declining, implementing genomic selection on a commercial scale still requires investment in infrastructure, training, and data management.</p></li>
<li><p>Regulatory Landscape: The potential application of gene-editing technologies in aquaculture is still subject to regulatory scrutiny. While some countries are moving toward acceptance, others remain cautious.</p></li>
<li><p>Data Integration: The vast amount of genomic and phenotypic data generated requires sophisticated bioinformatics tools for analysis. Efforts like AquaMine (a genomic database for aquaculture species) are helping streamline this process ￼.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="looking-ahead-the-future-of-shellfish-aquaculture" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="looking-ahead-the-future-of-shellfish-aquaculture">Looking Ahead: The Future of Shellfish Aquaculture</h2>
<p>The next decade of shellfish aquaculture will be defined by how well the industry can harness the power of genomics. As sequencing technology becomes more affordable and bioinformatics tools become more accessible, we are likely to see:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>More refined and efficient breeding programs using genomic selection.</p></li>
<li><p>Greater adoption of multi-omics approaches to understand complex traits like disease resistance and stress tolerance.</p></li>
<li><p>The potential emergence of gene-edited shellfish with enhanced resilience to climate change.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>By integrating these tools into aquaculture operations, we can ensure that shellfish farming remains a sustainable and resilient industry—one that continues to provide ecological and economic benefits to coastal communities while supporting global food security.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>
<p><a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12864-025-11247-z">The review by Andersen et al.&nbsp;(2025)</a> highlights an exciting and rapidly evolving field. Shellfish may not have received as much genomic attention as salmon or tilapia in the past, but that is changing. With continued investment in research, training, and industry partnerships, shellfish aquaculture is poised to become a model for sustainable, high-tech food production in the 21st century.</p>

  <title>Cracking the Code of Pacific Cod</title>
  <dc:creator>Laura Spencer</dc:creator>
  <link>https://faculty.washington.edu/sr320/posts/sr320-cod2/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 






<p>What if the future of an entire fish population hinged on tiny changes in their DNA? In the frigid waters of the North Pacific, juvenile Pacific cod are facing an uncertain future as ocean temperatures rise. Our research is uncovering how these fish respond to warming waters—at the molecular level—and what that means for their survival.</p>
<p><strong>The Science Behind Survival</strong></p>
<p>At first glance, Pacific cod might seem like just another fish. But beneath the surface, their genetic makeup holds clues to how they adapt—or struggle—when faced with environmental stress. In our latest study, we’re diving deep into the connection between a cod’s genes and its ability to thrive in different temperatures.</p>
<p>We analyzed DNA and gene activity (transcriptomics) in young Pacific cod exposed to a range of temperatures, from icy 0°C to a heatwave-like 16°C. By combining this “genome-to-phenome” data—essentially linking genetic information to physical traits—we’re beginning to see which fish have the genetic tools to survive in a warming world.</p>
<p><strong>A Genetic Blueprint for Resilience</strong></p>
<p>One of the most intriguing findings comes from a process called <strong>Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS)</strong>, where we scan the entire genome for small genetic differences linked to key traits. One of the most revealing traits we studied is the <strong>hepatosomatic index (HSI)</strong>—a measure of how much energy a fish stores in its liver. Since fat storage is critical for surviving harsh winters, understanding which fish can accumulate liver lipids under stress is essential.</p>
<p><img src="http://gannet.fish.washington.edu/seashell/snaps/2025-02-17_09-17-29.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Our data revealed <strong>specific genetic variants linked to liver size</strong>, some of which are connected to genes regulating appetite and metabolism. One gene in particular, likely involved in serotonin signaling (which affects hunger), seems to influence whether a juvenile cod stores enough fat when temperatures rise.</p>
<p><strong>Can Genes Predict Performance?</strong></p>
<p>Beyond genetics, we also examined how <strong>gene expression (RNA activity) relates to fish growth and condition</strong>. We identified a set of genes that are highly active in the strongest, most resilient fish under warm conditions. This genetic “signature” could help scientists predict which fish populations are best suited to handle climate shifts.</p>
<p><img src="http://gannet.fish.washington.edu/seashell/snaps/2025-02-17_09-18-11.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>By looking at <strong>composite performance indices (CPI)</strong>—which combine growth rate, body condition, and liver fat content—we found a distinct pattern: some fish are naturally equipped to thrive in warming seas, while others may struggle.</p>
<p><strong>A Look to the Past—and the Future</strong></p>
<p>To understand if these genetic traits have changed over time, we’re also analyzing historical samples from Pacific cod collected near Kodiak, Alaska, dating back to 2008. This will help us determine if recent marine heatwaves have already begun shaping the genetic makeup of young cod. If we find shifts in key genes over time, it could be a sign that natural selection is at work—favoring fish that can cope with temperature extremes.</p>
<p><strong>Next Steps: From Lab to Ocean Conservation</strong></p>
<p>Right now, we’re fine-tuning our analyses and comparing our results with other research teams, including NOAA scientists studying broader environmental factors. Our goal? To pinpoint the most critical genetic regions that influence temperature tolerance—and ultimately, to inform fisheries management strategies that support the resilience of Pacific cod populations.</p>
<p>As marine heatwaves become more frequent, understanding these genetic adaptations is more than just an academic pursuit. It’s about safeguarding a vital species in the face of climate change—ensuring that Pacific cod, and the people who depend on them, have a future in our warming oceans.</p>

  <title>Harnessing Shellfish Environmental Memory for a Resilient Future</title>
  <dc:creator>Steven Roberts</dc:creator>
  <link>https://faculty.washington.edu/sr320/posts/sr320-WSG/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 






<p>Shellfish aquaculture is facing increasing challenges due to climate change, ocean acidification, and other environmental stressors. However, research is showing that environmental memory—the ability of organisms to retain and transmit adaptive responses to stress—may offer a promising strategy for improving resilience in aquaculture species.</p>
<p>At the 2025 Washington Sea Grant workshop, researchers and industry professionals came together to explore how environmental priming—exposing shellfish to controlled stress conditions—could be leveraged to enhance survival, growth, and performance.</p>
<section id="industry-engagement-and-perceptions" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="industry-engagement-and-perceptions">Industry Engagement and Perceptions</h2>
<p>To better understand industry perspectives, a survey of shellfish growers was conducted to gauge their views on environmental priming as an adaptation strategy. The results were enlightening:<br>
• 78% of hatchery operators indicated they would consider implementing environmental priming, though most preferred to see supporting data first.<br>
• 70% of respondents said they would be willing to pay more for primed seed, provided evidence from test plots or research-supported literature was available.</p>
<p>This feedback underscores the importance of continued scientific research to validate environmental priming techniques and demonstrate their effectiveness in real-world aquaculture operations.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-is-environmental-priming">What is Environmental Priming?</h2>
<p>Environmental priming involves exposing shellfish to controlled stressors—such as temperature fluctuations, salinity changes, or immune challenges—to enhance their resilience later in life. Research has shown promising results across multiple species:</p>
<p>• Olympia oysters: Parental priming increased offspring survival in field conditions.<br>
• Pacific geoduck: Early-life priming led to improved growth rates later in life.<br>
• Manila clams: Offspring from primed parents exhibited better growth and survival rates.</p>

  <title>Coral Larvae and Thermal Stress</title>
  <link>https://faculty.washington.edu/sr320/posts/ariana-paper/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 






<p>As climate change continues to drive rising ocean temperatures, coral reef ecosystems face an unprecedented crisis. Coral bleaching events, characterized by the breakdown of the mutualistic relationship between corals and their algal endosymbionts (Symbiodiniaceae), have become increasingly common, threatening the persistence of coral reefs worldwide. While much research has focused on adult corals, new studies are shedding light on how early life stages respond to thermal stress. <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002875">A recent study by Huffmyer et al.&nbsp;(2024), published in&nbsp;<em>PLOS Biology</em></a>, provides novel insights into how coral larvae cope with increased temperatures by modifying nitrogen assimilation to stabilize symbiotic relationships and mitigate bleaching risk.</p>
<section id="the-crucial-role-of-coral-larvae-in-reef-resilience" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-crucial-role-of-coral-larvae-in-reef-resilience"><strong>The Crucial Role of Coral Larvae in Reef Resilience</strong></h3>
<p>Reef-building corals rely on their symbionts to produce energy-rich photosynthates that fuel metabolic processes. However, when subjected to thermal stress, this delicate exchange can be disrupted, leading to the expulsion of symbionts and loss of critical energy sources. Understanding how coral larvae respond to environmental stress is particularly important, as their ability to establish symbiosis and successfully settle onto reefs determines the future of coral populations.</p>
<p>The study focused on&nbsp;<em>Montipora capitata</em>, a dominant reef-building coral in Hawai‘i that vertically transmits Symbiodiniaceae to its offspring. The researchers subjected symbiotic larvae to a 2.5°C increase in temperature for three days and assessed metabolic responses, photosynthetic performance, and stable isotope-labeled metabolite exchange.</p>

<section id="key-findings-nitrogen-assimilation-as-a-protective-mechanism" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="key-findings-nitrogen-assimilation-as-a-protective-mechanism"><strong>Key Findings: Nitrogen Assimilation as a Protective Mechanism</strong></h3>
<p>Contrary to expectations, the study found that while larvae exhibited significant metabolic depression under high temperatures—indicated by a 19% reduction in respiration rates—they did not experience bleaching or a decline in survival and settlement rates. Photosynthetic activity remained stable, and the symbiont population density was maintained despite thermal stress.</p>
<p>A crucial discovery was that coral larvae increased ammonium assimilation and urea metabolism while sequestering nitrogen into dipeptides. This shift suggests that larvae actively modulate nitrogen cycling to maintain symbiotic balance. By limiting nitrogen availability to the symbionts, the coral hosts may be promoting sustained photosynthate translocation, ensuring that energy supply remains uninterrupted under heat stress.</p>

<section id="metabolic-trade-offs-and-implications-for-coral-survival" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="metabolic-trade-offs-and-implications-for-coral-survival"><strong>Metabolic Trade-offs and Implications for Coral Survival</strong></h3>
<p>While glucose translocation from symbiont to host was maintained, the study revealed reduced metabolism of glucose through central carbon pathways such as glycolysis. This metabolic shift implies a trade-off: larvae prioritize nitrogen assimilation over carbohydrate breakdown, potentially conserving energy for essential physiological functions.</p>
<p>The authors propose that nitrogen limitation imposed on Symbiodiniaceae encourages continued carbon transfer to the host, preventing the symbionts from hoarding fixed carbon, which could otherwise disrupt the mutualistic relationship. This mechanism highlights a potential resilience strategy in coral early life stages that may influence reef recovery following bleaching events.</p>
</section>
<section id="future-directions-and-conservation-implications" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="future-directions-and-conservation-implications"><strong>Future Directions and Conservation Implications</strong></h3>
<p>Understanding the physiological mechanisms that allow coral larvae to withstand heat stress has significant implications for reef conservation and restoration efforts. If coral larvae can naturally modulate nitrogen metabolism to maintain symbiosis, selective breeding or assisted evolution approaches may enhance these traits in vulnerable species.</p>
<p>Additionally, further research should investigate whether similar nitrogen assimilation strategies are present in adult corals or if this is a life-stage-specific adaptation. Given the increasing frequency of marine heatwaves, identifying and promoting heat-resilient traits in corals could be a crucial component of future conservation strategies.</p>
</section>
<section id="conclusion" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>
<p>Huffmyer et al.&nbsp;(2024) provide compelling evidence that coral larvae can mitigate thermal stress through nitrogen assimilation, maintaining stable symbiosis even under elevated temperatures. By uncovering this metabolic adaptation, the study advances our understanding of coral resilience mechanisms and underscores the importance of protecting early life stages in reef conservation efforts. As climate change accelerates, these insights may inform new strategies to support coral reef survival in a warming world.</p>

  <title>Turning the tide</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 






<p><strong>Chris is featured on UW’s “Be Boundless” site. Read full article <a href="https://www.washington.edu/boundless/turning-the-tide-marine-biology/">here</a>. Below is a short snippet of the feature along with an amazing video!</strong></p>
<p>On a windy June afternoon, Chris Mantegna, ’21, encourages a half-dozen undergraduates to flip over barnacle-studded rocks and sift through seaweed. Equipped with clipboards to record their findings, they’re creating a snapshot of the organisms in the island’s intertidal zone — from orange sea cucumbers to the camouflaged armored mollusks called chitons.</p>
<p>Mantegna, a third-year graduate student in aquatic and fishery sciences, has spent the past three summers in Washington’s San Juan Islands, mentoring undergrads here on Yellow Island — a pristine 11-acre nature preserve owned by the Nature Conservancy. She created this eight-week program for students to get their hands dirty in the field and learn cutting-edge lab techniques at the UW Friday Harbor Laboratories — where she had a transformational research experience herself as a Husky undergrad.</p>
<p>This mentorship program reflects Mantegna’s passion both for advancing the science and for making it more inclusive and accessible to others. Her face lights up when she spots a small chiton (her favorite) clinging to the bottom of a rock, and she invites others to feel the mollusk’s tough plated back. Even Mantegna’s doctoral work — examining the genetic response of shellfish to contaminants in Puget Sound waterways — has a focus on community outreach and environmental literacy.</p>

<p>Mantegna says we have a better chance at fighting climate change when everyone — scientists and community members — feels connected to their environment and each other. “I can tell you that the ocean is dying or that we have too much acidification,” says Mantegna, a U.S. Navy veteran who is the first in her family to graduate from college. “But it doesn’t matter if you’ve never had the chance to feel the joy that comes from this place.”</p>

  <title>Exploring Pacific Cod Resilience in a Warming Ocean</title>
  <dc:creator>Laura Spencer</dc:creator>
  <link>https://faculty.washington.edu/sr320/posts/posts/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 






<p>In our latest update on the Pacific cod juvenile temperature study, we've gained deeper insights into how these remarkable fish respond to different temperatures. This research is part of a larger effort to understand the resilience of marine species in changing environments.</p>
<p><strong>Genetic Insights Reveal Population Origins</strong></p>
<p>We began with genetic analyses, using data from thousands of genetic markers to determine the origin of our experimental fish. All our test fish were linked to the spawning grounds in the western Gulf of Alaska (wGOA) and the Eastern Bering Sea (EBS). This finding allows us to focus on the thermal resilience of cod from this particular region, which is vital as they face shifts in temperature in their natural habitats.</p>
<p><img src="http://gannet.fish.washington.edu/seashell/snaps/2024-11-06_15-00-51.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p><strong>Temperature's Role in Energy and Lipid Storage</strong></p>
<p>Our collaborator Louise Copement analyzed liver lipids in these juvenile cod, focusing on triglycerides and other key lipid types that are crucial for overwinter survival. The results showed a clear trend: energy storage, primarily in the form of triglycerides, peaked at 9°C, then dropped sharply at higher temperatures, especially at 16°C. This suggests that extreme warmth could deplete essential energy reserves, reducing the fish's survival prospects in the cold winter months.</p>
<p><img src="http://gannet.fish.washington.edu/seashell/snaps/2024-11-06_15-01-47.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p><strong>Optimal Growth Temperatures and Physiological Responses</strong></p>
<p>We also observed that juvenile cod exhibit optimal growth at approximately 12.3°C, slightly higher than previous findings. With higher temperatures, growth rates plateau or decline, mirroring the energy storage patterns. Interestingly, the gene expression data from liver tissues revealed significant temperature-driven shifts, especially in energy production, lipid metabolism, and immune response genes. This molecular data adds a new layer to our understanding of temperature tolerance.</p>

<p><strong>Integrated Data: A Pathway to Genomic Resilience Markers</strong></p>
<p>Combining growth, lipid, and gene expression data, we've started identifying genes that correlate with enhanced resilience at specific temperatures. This approach could spotlight genetic markers for thermal resilience, offering clues about cod populations best suited to future ocean conditions.</p>
<p>In summary, this research underscores the delicate balance juvenile Pacific cod must maintain in their energy reserves and growth under variable temperatures. These findings will help guide conservation and management efforts as we work to protect Pacific cod populations in a warming world.</p>
