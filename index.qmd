Our lab investigates how marine organisms *remember* and respond to environmental change including how past and present conditions shape physiology, performance, and resilience across life stages and generations. We use integrative, mechanistic approaches that link molecular regulation to organismal outcomes, connecting genetics and epigenetics with physiology to reveal when responses are flexible, when they persist, and which signals best predict resilience in dynamic coastal systems.

We prioritize open, reproducible science. Our research products and workflows are shared broadly, including online [lab notebooks](notebooks.qmd), [code, data](https://github.com/RobertsLab), and [presentations](https://faculty.washington.edu/sr320/publications.html#recent-presentations) so results can be evaluated, reused, and extended.

Below is a snapshot of current activity. Use the sidebar to explore our people, research themes, and lab culture.
